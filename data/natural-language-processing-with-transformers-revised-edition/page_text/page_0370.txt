Well that’s the end of the ride; thanks for joining us on this journey through the trans‐
formers landscape! Throughout this book we’ve explored how transformers can
address a wide range of tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results. In this chapter we’ve
seen how the current generation of models are being pushed to their limits with scal‐
ing and how they are also branching out into new domains and modalities.
If you want to reinforce the concepts and skills that you’ve learned in this book, here
are a few ideas for where to go from here:
<i>Join</i> <i>a</i> <i>Hugging</i> <i>Face</i> <i>community</i> <i>event</i>
Hugging Face hosts short sprints focused on improving the libraries in the eco‐
system, and these events are a great way to meet the community and get a taste
for open source software development. So far there have been sprints on adding
600+ datasets to Datasets, fine-tuning 300+ ASR models in various languages,
and implementing hundreds of projects in JAX/Flax.
<i>Build</i> <i>your</i> <i>own</i> <i>project</i>
One very effective way to test your knowledge in machine learning is to build a
project to solve a problem that interests you. You could reimplement a trans‐
former paper, or apply transformers to a novel domain.
<i>Contribute</i> <i>a</i> <i>model</i> <i>to</i> <i>Transformers</i>
If you’re looking for something more advanced, then contributing a newly pub‐
lished architecture to Transformers is a great way to dive into the nuts and
bolts of the library. There is a detailed guide to help you get started in the
Transformers documentation.
<i>Blog</i> <i>about</i> <i>what</i> <i>you’ve</i> <i>learned</i>
Teaching others what you’ve learned is a powerful test of your own knowledge,
and in a sense this was one of the driving motivations behind us writing this
book! There are great tools to help you get started with technical blogging; we
recommend <i>fastpages</i> as you can easily use Jupyter notebooks for everything.
