platforms provided by websites like Amazon, but it usually takes days to get an
answer (if you get one at all). Wouldn’t it be nice if we could get an immediate answer,
like in the Google example from Figure 7-1? Let’s see if we can do this using
transformers!

To build our QA system we’ll use the SubjQA dataset, 2 which consists of more than
10,000 customer reviews in English about products and services in six domains: Trip‐
Advisor, Restaurants, Movies, Books, Electronics, and Grocery. As illustrated in
Figure 7-2, each review is associated with a question that can be answered using one
or more sentences from the review. 3
<i>Figure</i> <i>7-2.</i> <i>A</i> <i>question</i> <i>about</i> <i>a</i> <i>product</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>corresponding</i> <i>review</i> <i>(the</i> <i>answer</i> <i>span</i>
<i>is</i> <i>underlined)</i>
The interesting aspect of this dataset is that most of the questions and answers are
<i>subjective;</i> that is, they depend on the personal experience of the users. The example
in Figure 7-2 shows why this feature makes the task potentially more difficult than
