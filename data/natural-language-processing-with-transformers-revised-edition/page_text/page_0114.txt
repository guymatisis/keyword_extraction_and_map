It is apparent that something is wrong with the labels of these samples; for example,
the United Nations and the Central African Republic are each labeled as a person! At
the same time, “8. Juli” in the first example is labeled as an organization. It turns out
the annotations for the PAN-X dataset were generated through an automated process.
Such annotations are often referred to as “silver standard” (in contrast to the “gold
standard” of human-generated annotations), and it is no surprise that there are cases
where the automated approach failed to produce sensible labels. In fact, such failure
modes are not unique to automatic approaches; even when humans carefully anno‐
tate data, mistakes can occur when the concentration of the annotators fades or they
simply misunderstand the sentence.
Another thing we noticed earlier was that parentheses and slashes had a relatively
high loss. Let’s look at a few examples of sequences with an opening parenthesis:
df_tmp = df.loc[df["input_tokens"].apply(lambda x: u"\u2581(" <b>in</b> x)].head(2)
<b>for</b> sample <b>in</b> get_samples(df_tmp):
display(sample)

In general we would not include the parentheses and their contents as part of the
named entity, but this seems to be the way the automatic extraction annotated the
documents. In the other examples, the parentheses contain a geographic specification.
While this is indeed a location as well, we might want disconnect it from the original
location in the annotations. This dataset consists of Wikipedia articles in different
languages, and the article titles often contain some sort of explanation in parentheses.
For instance, in the first example the text in parentheses indicates that Hama is an
“Unternehmen,” or company in English. These are important details to know when
we roll out the model, as they might have implications on the downstream perfor‐
mance of the whole pipeline the model is part of.
With a relatively simple analysis, we’ve identified some weaknesses in both our model
and the dataset. In a real use case we would iterate on this step, cleaning up the
