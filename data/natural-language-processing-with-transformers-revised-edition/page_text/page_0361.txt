What's the topic in chapter 4?
Predicted answer: Summarization
==================================================
What is the total number of pages?
Predicted answer: SUM > 10, 36, 24, 46, 19, 3
==================================================
On which page does the chapter about question-answering start?
Predicted answer: AVERAGE > 74
==================================================
How many chapters have more than 20 pages?
Predicted answer: COUNT > 1, 2, 3
==================================================
For the first chapter, the model predicted exactly one cell with no aggregation. If we
look at the table, we see that the answer is in fact correct. In the next example the
model predicted all the cells containing the number of pages in combination with the
sum aggregator, which again is the correct way of calculating the total number of
pages. The answer to question three is also correct; the average aggregation is not
necessary in that case, but it doesn’t make a difference. Finally, we have a question
that is a little bit more complex. To determine how many chapters have more than 20
pages we first need to find out which chapters satisfy that criterion and then count
them. It seem that TAPAS again got it right and correctly determined that chapters 1,
2, and 3 have more than 20 pages, and added a count aggregator to the cells.
The kinds of questions we asked can also be solved with a few simple Pandas com‐
mands; however, the ability to ask questions in natural language instead of Python
code allows a much wider audience to query the data to answer specific questions.
Imagine such tools in the hands of business analysts or managers who are able verify
their own hypotheses about the data!

So far we’ve looked at extending transformers to a single new modality. TAPAS is
arguably multimodal since it combines text and tables, but the table is also treated as
text. In this section we examine transformers that combine two modalities at once:
audio plus text and vision plus text.

Although being able to use text to interface with a computer is a huge step forward,
using spoken language is an even more natural way for us to communicate. You can
see this trend in industry, where applications such as Siri and Alexa are on the rise
and becoming progressively more useful. Also, for a large fraction of the population,
writing and reading are more challenging than speaking. So, being able to process
and understand audio is not only convenient, but can help many people access more
information. A common task in this domain is <i>automatic</i> <i>speech</i> <i>recognition</i> (ASR),
