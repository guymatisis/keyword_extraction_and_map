Now imagine that you are a data scientist who needs to build a system that can auto‐
matically identify emotional states such as “anger” or “joy” that people express about
your company’s product on Twitter. In this chapter, we’ll tackle this task using a var‐
iant of BERT called DistilBERT.1 The main advantage of this model is that it achieves
comparable performance to BERT, while being significantly smaller and more effi‐
cient. This enables us to train a classifier in a few minutes, and if you want to train a
larger BERT model you can simply change the checkpoint of the pretrained model. A
<i>checkpoint</i> corresponds to the set of weights that are loaded into a given transformer
architecture.
This will also be our first encounter with three of the core libraries from the Hugging
Face ecosystem: Datasets, Tokenizers, and Transformers. As shown in
Figure 2-2, these libraries will allow us to quickly go from raw text to a fine-tuned
model that can be used for inference on new tweets. So, in the spirit of Optimus
Prime, let’s dive in, “transform, and roll out!”2

To build our emotion detector we’ll use a great dataset from an article that explored
how emotions are represented in English Twitter messages.3 Unlike most sentiment
analysis datasets that involve just “positive” and “negative” polarities, this dataset con‐
tains six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Given a tweet,
our task will be to train a model that can classify it into one of these emotions.
