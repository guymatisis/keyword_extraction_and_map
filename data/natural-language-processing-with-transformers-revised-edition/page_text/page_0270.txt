Comparing the zero-shot pipeline to the baseline, we observe two things:
1. If we have less than 50 labeled samples, the zero-shot pipeline handily outper‚Äê
forms the baseline.
2. Even above 50 samples, the performance of the zero-shot pipeline is superior
when considering both the micro and macro <i>F</i> -scores. The results for the micro

<i>F</i> -score tell us that the baseline performs well on the frequent classes, while the
