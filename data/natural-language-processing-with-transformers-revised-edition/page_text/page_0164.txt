Unfortunately, there is no single strategy to solve this problem, and to date this is still
an open and active research question. For example, recent work by OpenAI showed
how to scale summarization by applying it recursively to long documents and using
human feedback in the loop.6
In the next chapter we’ll look at question answering, which is the task of providing an
answer to a question based on a text passage. In contrast to summarization, with this
task there exist good strategies to deal with long or many documents, and we’ll show
you how to scale question answering to thousands of documents.
