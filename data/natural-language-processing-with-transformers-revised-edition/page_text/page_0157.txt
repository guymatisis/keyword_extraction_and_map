We’ve worked through a lot of details on text summarization and evaluation, so let’s
put this to use to train a custom text summarization model! For our application, we’ll
use the SAMSum dataset developed by Samsung, which consists of a collection of dia‐
logues along with brief summaries. In an enterprise setting, these dialogues might
represent the interactions between a customer and the support center, so generating
accurate summaries can help improve customer service and detect common patterns
among customer requests. Let’s load it and look at an example:
dataset_samsum = load_dataset("samsum")
split_lengths = [len(dataset_samsum[split])for split <b>in</b> dataset_samsum]
<b>print(f"Split</b> lengths: {split_lengths}")
<b>print(f"Features:</b> {dataset_samsum['train'].column_names}")
<b>print("\nDialogue:")</b>
<b>print(dataset_samsum["test"][0]["dialogue"])</b>
<b>print("\nSummary:")</b>
<b>print(dataset_samsum["test"][0]["summary"])</b>
Split lengths: [14732, 819, 818]
Features: ['id', 'dialogue', 'summary']
Dialogue:
Hannah: Hey, do you have Betty's number?
Amanda: Lemme check
Hannah: <file_gif>
Amanda: Sorry, can't find it.
Amanda: Ask Larry
Amanda: He called her last time we were at the park together
Hannah: I don't know him well
Hannah: <file_gif>
Amanda: Don't be shy, he's very nice
Hannah: If you say so..
Hannah: I'd rather you texted him
Amanda: Just text him
Hannah: Urgh.. Alright
Hannah: Bye
Amanda: Bye bye
Summary:
Hannah needs Betty's number but Amanda doesn't have it. She needs to contact
Larry.
The dialogues look like what you would expect from a chat via SMS or WhatsApp,
including emojis and placeholders for GIFs. The dialogue field contains the full text
summary
and the the summarized dialogue. Could a model that was fine-tuned on the
CNN/DailyMail dataset deal with that? Let’s find out!
