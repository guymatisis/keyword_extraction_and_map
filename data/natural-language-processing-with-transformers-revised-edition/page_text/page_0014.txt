einen Austausch von Megatron für die Optimus Prime Figur habe ich bestellt.
Anbei sind Kopien meiner Aufzeichnungen über diesen Kauf. Ich erwarte, bald von
Ihnen zu hören. Aufrichtig, Bumblebee.
Again, the model produced a very good translation that correctly uses German’s for‐
mal pronouns, like “Ihrem” and “Sie.” Here we’ve also shown how you can override
the default model in the pipeline to pick the best one for your application—and you
can find models for thousands of language pairs on the Hugging Face Hub. Before we
take a step back and look at the whole Hugging Face ecosystem, let’s examine one last
application.

Let’s say you would like to be able to provide faster replies to customer feedback by
having access to an autocomplete function. With a text generation model you can do
this as follows:
generator = pipeline("text-generation")
response = "Dear Bumblebee, I am sorry to hear that your order was mixed up."
prompt = text + "\n\nCustomer service response:\n" + response
outputs = generator(prompt, max_length=200)
<b>print(outputs[0]['generated_text'])</b>
Dear Amazon, last week I ordered an Optimus Prime action figure from your online
store in Germany. Unfortunately, when I opened the package, I discovered to my
horror that I had been sent an action figure of Megatron instead! As a lifelong
enemy of the Decepticons, I hope you can understand my dilemma. To resolve the
issue, I demand an exchange of Megatron for the Optimus Prime figure I ordered.
Enclosed are copies of my records concerning this purchase. I expect to hear
from you soon. Sincerely, Bumblebee.
Customer service response:
Dear Bumblebee, I am sorry to hear that your order was mixed up. The order was
completely mislabeled, which is very common in our online store, but I can
appreciate it because it was my understanding from this site and our customer
service of the previous day that your order was not made correct in our mind and
that we are in a process of resolving this matter. We can assure you that your
order
OK, maybe we wouldn’t want to use this completion to calm Bumblebee down, but
you get the general idea.
Now that you’ve seen a few cool applications of transformer models, you might be
wondering where the training happens. All of the models that we’ve used in this chap‐
ter are publicly available and already fine-tuned for the task at hand. In general, how‐
ever, you’ll want to fine-tune models on your own data, and in the following chapters
you will learn how to do just that.
