the cumulative probability distribution of the model’s outputs at <i>T</i> = 1 as seen in
Figure 5-6.
Let’s tease apart these plots, since they contain a lot of information. In the upper plot
−8
we can see a histogram of the token probabilities. It has a peak around 10 and a
−4
second, smaller peak around 10 , followed by a sharp drop with just a handful of
−2 −1
tokens occurring with probability between 10 and 10 . Looking at this diagram,
we can see that the probability of picking the token with the highest probability (the
−1
isolated bar at 10 ) is 1 in 10.

In the lower plot, we’ve ordered the tokens by descending probability and calculated
the cumulative sum of the first 10,000 tokens (in total, there are 50,257 tokens in
GPT-2’s vocabulary). The curved line represents the probability of picking any of the
