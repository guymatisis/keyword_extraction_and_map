hosts more than 20 million code repositories. Many of them are small or test reposi‐
tories created by users for learning, future side projects, or testing purposes.
GitHub repositories can be accessed in two main ways:
• Via the GitHub REST API, like we saw in Chapter 9 when we downloaded all the
GitHub issues of the Transformers repository
• Via public dataset inventories like Google BigQuery
Since the REST API is rate limited and we need a lot data for our pretraining corpus,
we’ll use Google BigQuery to extract all the Python repositories. The bigquery-
public-data.github_repos.contents
table contains copies of all ASCII files that are
less than 10 MB in size. Projects also need to be open source to be included, as deter‐
mined by GitHub’s License API.
The Google BigQuery dataset doesn’t contain star or downstream
usage information. For those attributes, we can use the GitHub
REST API or a service like Libraries.io that monitors open source
packages. Indeed, a team from GitHub recently released a dataset
called CodeSearchNet that filtered repositories used in at least one
downstream task using information from Libraries.io.
Let’s have a look at what it takes to create our code dataset with Google BigQuery.
<b>CreatingadatasetwithGoogleBigQuery</b>
We’ll begin by extracting all the Python files in GitHub public repositories from the
snapshot on Google BigQuery. For the sake of reproducibility and in case the policy
around free usage of BigQuery changes in the future, we will also share this dataset
on the Hugging Face Hub. The steps to export these files are adapted from the Trans‐
Coder implementation and are as follows:5
1. Create a Google Cloud account (a free trial should be sufficient).
2. Create a Google BigQuery project under your account.
3. In this project, create a dataset.
4. In this dataset, create a table where the results of the SQL request will be stored.
5. Prepare and run the following SQL query on the github_repos (to save the
query results, select More > Query Options, check the “Set a destination table for
query results” box, and specify the table name):
