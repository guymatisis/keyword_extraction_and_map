B-ORG
We see that has the highest average loss, which means that determining the
beginning of an organization poses a challenge to our model.
We can break this down further by plotting the confusion matrix of the token classifi‐
cation, where we see that the beginning of an organization is often confused with the
I-ORG
subsequent token:
<b>from</b> <b>sklearn.metrics</b> <b>import</b> ConfusionMatrixDisplay, confusion_matrix
<b>def</b> plot_confusion_matrix(y_preds, y_true, labels):
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_preds, normalize="true")
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=labels)
disp.plot(cmap="Blues", values_format=".2f", ax=ax, colorbar=False)
plt.title("Normalized confusion matrix")
plt.show()
plot_confusion_matrix(df_tokens["labels"], df_tokens["predicted_label"],
tags.names)
From the plot, we can see that our model tends to confuse the B-ORG and I-ORG enti‐
ties the most. Otherwise, it is quite good at classifying the remaining entities, which is
clear by the near diagonal nature of the confusion matrix.
