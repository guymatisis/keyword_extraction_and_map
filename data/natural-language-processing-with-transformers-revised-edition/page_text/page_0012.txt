You can see that the pipeline detected all the entities and also assigned a category
ORG LOC PER
such as (organization), (location), or (person) to each of them. Here we
used the aggregation_strategy argument to group the words according to the mod‐
el’s predictions. For example, the entity “Optimus Prime” is composed of two words,
MISC
but is assigned a single category: (miscellaneous). The scores tell us how confi‐
dent the model was about the entities it identified. We can see that it was least confi‐
dent about “Decepticons” and the first occurrence of “Megatron”, both of which it
failed to group as a single entity.
# word
See those weird hash symbols ( ) in the column in the previ‐
ous table? These are produced by the model’s <i>tokenizer,</i> which
splits words into atomic units called <i>tokens.</i> You’ll learn all about
tokenization in Chapter 2.
Extracting all the named entities in a text is nice, but sometimes we would like to ask
more targeted questions. This is where we can use <i>question</i> <i>answering.</i>
<header><largefont><b>Question</b></largefont> <largefont><b>Answering</b></largefont></header>
In question answering, we provide the model with a passage of text called the <i>context,</i>
along with a question whose answer we’d like to extract. The model then returns the
span of text corresponding to the answer. Let’s see what we get when we ask a specific
question about our customer feedback:
reader = pipeline("question-answering")
question = "What does the customer want?"
outputs = reader(question=question, context=text)
pd.DataFrame([outputs])
