rotated cat is still a cat). For text, data augmentation is somewhat trickier because per‐
turbing the words or characters can completely change the meaning. For example, the
two questions “Are elephants heavier than mice?” and “Are mice heavier than ele‐
phants?” differ by a single word swap, but have opposite answers. However, if the text
consists of more than a few sentences (like our GitHub issues do), then the noise
introduced by these types of transformations will generally not affect the label. In
practice, there are two types of data augmentation techniques that are commonly
used:
<i>Back</i> <i>translation</i>
Take a text in the source language, translate it into one or more target languages
using machine translation, and then translate it back to the source language. Back
translation tends to works best for high-resource languages or corpora that don’t
contain too many domain-specific words.
<i>Token</i> <i>perturbations</i>
Given a text from the training set, randomly choose and perform simple trans‐
formations like random synonym replacement, word insertion, swap, or
4
deletion.
Examples of these transformations are shown in Table 9-2. For a detailed list of other
data augmentation techniques for NLP, we recommend reading Amit Chaudhary’s
blog post “A Visual Survey of Data Augmentation in NLP”.

You can implement back translation using machine translation models like M2M100,
while libraries like <i>NlpAug</i> and <i>TextAttack</i> provide various recipes for token pertur‐
bations. In this section, we’ll focus on using synonym replacement as it’s simple to
implement and gets across the main idea behind data augmentation.
