For this chapter let’s assume that we want to perform NER for a customer based in
Switzerland, where there are four national languages (with English often serving as a
bridge between them). Let’s start by getting a suitable multilingual corpus for this
problem.
<i>Zero-shot</i> <i>transfer</i> or <i>zero-shot</i> <i>learning</i> usually refers to the task of
training a model on one set of labels and then evaluating it on a
different set of labels. In the context of transformers, zero-shot
learning may also refer to situations where a language model like
GPT-3 is evaluated on a downstream task that it wasn’t even fine-
tuned on.

In this chapter we will be using a subset of the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of
Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark called WikiANN or PAN-X.2 This
dataset consists of Wikipedia articles in many languages, including the four most
commonly spoken languages in Switzerland: German (62.9%), French (22.9%), Ital‐
LOC PER
ian (8.4%), and English (5.9%). Each article is annotated with (location),
(person), and ORG (organization) tags in the “inside-outside-beginning” (IOB2) for‐
B-
mat. In this format, a prefix indicates the beginning of an entity, and consecutive
I- O
tokens belonging to the same entity are given an prefix. An tag indicates that the
token does not belong to any entity. For example, the following sentence:
Jeff Dean is a computer scientist at Google in California
would be labeled in IOB2 format as shown in Table 4-1.
<i>Table</i> <i>4-1.</i> <i>An</i> <i>example</i> <i>of</i> <i>a</i> <i>sequence</i> <i>annotated</i> <i>with</i> <i>named</i> <i>entities</i>
<b>Tokens</b> Jeff Dean is a computer scientist at Google in California
<b>Tags</b> B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-ORG O B-LOC
To load one of the PAN-X subsets in XTREME, we’ll need to know which <i>dataset</i>
<i>configuration</i> to pass the load_dataset() function. Whenever you’re dealing with a
get_dataset_config_names()
dataset that has multiple domains, you can use the
function to find out which subsets are available:
