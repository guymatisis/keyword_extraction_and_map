perfect precision! For this reason, the authors of the BLEU paper introduced a slight
modification: a word is only counted as many times as it occurs in the reference. To
illustrate this point, suppose we have the reference text “the cat is on the mat” and the
generated text “the the the the the the”.
From this simple example, we can calculate the precision values as follows:
6
<i>p</i> =
<i>vanilla</i> 6
2
<i>p</i> =
<i>mod</i> 6
and we can see that the simple correction has produced a much more reasonable
value. Now let’s extend this by not only looking at single words, but <i>n-grams</i> as well.
Let’s assume we have one generated sentence, <i>snt,</i> that we want to compare against a
′
reference sentence, <i>snt</i> . We extract all possible <i>n-grams</i> of degree <i>n</i> and do the
accounting to get the precision <i>p</i> :
<i>n</i>
∑ <i>Count</i> <i>n‐gram</i>
<i>n‐gram</i> ∈ <i>snt</i> ′ <i>clip</i>
<i>p</i> =
<i>n</i> ∑ <i>Count</i> <i>n‐gram</i>
<i>n‐gram</i> ∈ <i>snt</i>
In order to avoid rewarding repetitive generations, the count in the numerator is clip‐
ped. What this means is that the occurrence count of an <i>n-gram</i> is capped at how
many times it appears in the reference sentence. Also note that the definition of a sen‐
tence is not very strict in this equation, and if you had a generated text spanning mul‐
tiple sentences you would treat it as one sentence.
In general we have more than one sample in the test set we want to evaluate, so we
need to slightly extend the equation by summing over all samples in the corpus <i>C:</i>
∑ ∑ <i>Count</i> <i>n‐gram</i>
<i>snt</i> ∈ <i>C</i> <i>n‐gram</i> ∈ <i>snt</i> ′ <i>clip</i>
<i>p</i> =
<i>n</i> ∑ ∑ <i>Count</i> <i>n‐gram</i>
<i>snt</i> ′ ∈ <i>C</i> <i>n‐gram</i> ∈ <i>snt</i>
We’re almost there. Since we are not looking at recall, all generated sequences that are
short but precise have a benefit compared to sentences that are longer. Therefore, the
precision score favors short generations. To compensate for that the authors of BLEU
introduced an additional term, the <i>brevity</i> <i>penalty:</i>
1−ℓ /ℓ
<i>ref</i> <i>gen</i>
<i>BR</i> = min 1,e
