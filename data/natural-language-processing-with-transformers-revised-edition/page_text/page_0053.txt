We now know that the joy is sometimes mislabeled and that the model is most confi‐
sadness
dent about predicting the label . With this information we can make targeted
improvements to our dataset, and also keep an eye on the class the model seems to be
very confident about.
The last step before serving the trained model is to save it for later usage. Trans‐
formers allows us to do this in a few steps, which we’ll show you in the next section.
<b>Savingandsharingthemodel</b>
The NLP community benefits greatly from sharing pretrained and fine-tuned models,
and everybody can share their models with others via the Hugging Face Hub. Any
community-generated model can be downloaded from the Hub just like we downloa‐
ded the DistilBERT model. With the Trainer API, saving and sharing a model is
simple:
trainer.push_to_hub(commit_message="Training completed!")
We can also use the fine-tuned model to make predictions on new tweets. Since we’ve
pipeline()
pushed our model to the Hub, we can now use it with the function, just
like we did in Chapter 1. First, let’s load the pipeline:
<b>from</b> <b>transformers</b> <b>import</b> pipeline
<i>#</i> <i>Change</i> <i>`transformersbook`</i> <i>to</i> <i>your</i> <i>Hub</i> <i>username</i>
model_id = "transformersbook/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-emotion"
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model=model_id)
