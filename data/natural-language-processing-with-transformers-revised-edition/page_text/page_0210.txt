To illustrate the benefits and trade-offs associated with each technique, we’ll use
intent detection as a case study; this is an important component of text-based assis‐
tants, where low latencies are critical for maintaining a conversation in real time.
Along the way you’ll learn how to create custom trainers, perform efficient hyper‐
parameter search, and gain a sense of what it takes to implement cutting-edge
research with Transformers. Let’s dive in!

Let’s suppose that we’re trying to build a text-based assistant for our company’s call
center so that customers can request their account balance or make bookings without
needing to speak with a human agent. In order to understand the goals of a customer,
our assistant will need to be able to classify a wide variety of natural language text
into a set of predefined actions or <i>intents.</i> For example, a customer might send a mes‐
sage like the following about an upcoming trip:
Hey, I’d like to rent a vehicle from Nov 1st to Nov 15th in Paris and I need a 15 passen‐
ger van
and our intent classifier could automatically categorize this as a <i>Car</i> <i>Rental</i> intent,
which then triggers an action and response. To be robust in a production environ‐
ment, our classifier will also need to be able to handle <i>out-of-scope</i> queries, where a
customer makes a query that doesn’t belong to any of the predefined intents and the
system should yield a fallback response. For example, in the second case shown in
Figure 8-2, a customer asks a question about sports (which is out of scope), and the
text assistant mistakenly classifies it as one of the known in-scope intents and returns
