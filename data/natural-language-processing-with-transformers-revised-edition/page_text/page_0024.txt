Dataset Dataset
which returns an instance of the class. The object is one of the core
data structures in Datasets, and we’ll be exploring many of its features throughout
the course of this book. For starters, it behaves like an ordinary Python array or list,
so we can query its length:
len(train_ds)
16000
or access a single example by its index:
train_ds[0]
{'label': 0, 'text': 'i didnt feel humiliated'}
Here we see that a single row is represented as a dictionary, where the keys corre‐
spond to the column names:
train_ds.column_names
['text', 'label']
and the values are the tweet and the emotion. This reflects the fact that Datasets is
based on <i>Apache</i> <i>Arrow,</i> which defines a typed columnar format that is more memory
efficient than native Python. We can see what data types are being used under the
features Dataset
hood by accessing the attribute of a object:
<b>print(train_ds.features)</b>
{'text': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'label': ClassLabel(num_classes=6,
names=['sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise'], names_file=None,
id=None)}
text string, label
In this case, the data type of the column is while the column is a
ClassLabel
special object that contains information about the class names and their
mapping to integers. We can also access several rows with a slice:
<b>print(train_ds[:5])</b>
{'text': ['i didnt feel humiliated', 'i can go from feeling so hopeless to so
damned hopeful just from being around someone who cares and is awake', 'im
grabbing a minute to post i feel greedy wrong', 'i am ever feeling nostalgic
about the fireplace i will know that it is still on the property', 'i am feeling
grouchy'], 'label': [0, 0, 3, 2, 3]}
Note that in this case, the dictionary values are now lists instead of individual ele‐
ments. We can also get the full column by name:
<b>print(train_ds["text"][:5])</b>
['i didnt feel humiliated', 'i can go from feeling so hopeless to so damned
hopeful just from being around someone who cares and is awake', 'im grabbing a
minute to post i feel greedy wrong', 'i am ever feeling nostalgic about the
fireplace i will know that it is still on the property', 'i am feeling grouchy']
