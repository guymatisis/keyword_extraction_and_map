Now that we’ve seen what the GitHub issues look like, let’s see how we can download
them to create our dataset.

Issues
To grab all the repository’s issues, we’ll use the GitHub REST API to poll the
endpoint. This endpoint returns a list of JSON objects, with each containing a large
number of fields about the issue at hand, including its state (open or closed), who
opened the issue, as well as the title, body, and labels we saw in Figure 9-2.
Since it takes a while to fetch all the issues, we’ve included a <i>github-issues-</i>
fetch_issues()
<i>transformers.jsonl</i> file in this book’s GitHub repository, along with a
function that you can use to download them yourself.
