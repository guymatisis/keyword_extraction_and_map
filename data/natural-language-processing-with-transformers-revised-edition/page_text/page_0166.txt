In this example, Google first retrieved around 319,000 documents that were relevant
to the query, and then performed an additional processing step to extract the answer
snippet with the corresponding passage and web page. It’s not hard to see why these
answer snippets are useful. For example, if we search for a trickier question like
“Which guitar tuning is the best?” Google doesn’t provide an answer, and instead we
have to click on one of the web pages returned by the search engine to find it
ourselves. 1
The general approach behind this technology is called <i>question</i> <i>answering</i> (QA).
There are many flavors of QA, but the most common is <i>extractive</i> <i>QA,</i> which involves
questions whose answer can be identified as a span of text in a document, where the
document might be a web page, legal contract, or news article. The two-stage process
of first retrieving relevant documents and then extracting answers from them is also
the basis for many modern QA systems, including semantic search engines, intelli‐
gent assistants, and automated information extractors. In this chapter, we’ll apply this
process to tackle a common problem facing ecommerce websites: helping consumers
answer specific queries to evaluate a product. We’ll see that customer reviews can be
used as a rich and challenging source of information for QA, and along the way we’ll
learn how transformers act as powerful <i>reading</i> <i>comprehension</i> models that can
extract meaning from text. Let’s begin by fleshing out the use case.
This chapter focuses on extractive QA, but other forms of QA may
be more suitable for your use case. For example, <i>community</i> <i>QA</i>
involves gathering question-answer pairs that are generated by
users on forums like Stack Overflow, and then using semantic sim‐
ilarity search to find the closest matching answer to a new ques‐
tion. There is also <i>long-form</i> <i>QA,</i> which aims to generate complex
paragraph-length answers to open-ended questions like “Why is
the sky blue?” Remarkably, it is also possible to do QA over tables,
and transformer models like TAPAS can even perform aggrega‐
tions to produce the final answer!

If you’ve ever purchased a product online, you probably relied on customer reviews
to help inform your decision. These reviews can often help answer specific questions
like “Does this guitar come with a strap?” or “Can I use this camera at night?” that
may be hard to answer from the product description alone. However, popular
products can have hundreds to thousands of reviews, so it can be a major drag to find
one that is relevant. One alternative is to post your question on the community QA
