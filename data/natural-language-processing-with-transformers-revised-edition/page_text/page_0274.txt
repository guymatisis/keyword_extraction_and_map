From the figure, we can see that a small amount of data augmentation improves the
<i>F</i> -score of the Naive Bayes classifier by around 5 points, and it overtakes the zero-

shot pipeline for the macro scores once we have around 170 training samples. Letâ€™s
now take a look at a method based on using the embeddings of large language
models.
