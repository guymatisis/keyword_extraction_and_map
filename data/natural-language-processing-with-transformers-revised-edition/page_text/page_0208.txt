Looking ahead, one exciting research area is <i>multimodal</i> <i>QA,</i> which involves QA over
multiple modalities like text, tables, and images. As described in the MultiModalQA
benchmark, 17 such systems could enable users to answer complex questions that inte‐
grate information across different modalities, like “When was the famous painting
with two touching fingers completed?” Another area with practical business applica‐
tions is QA over a <i>knowledge</i> <i>graph,</i> where the nodes of the graph correspond to real-
world entities and their relations are defined by the edges. By encoding factoids as
(subject, <i>predicate,</i> <i>object)</i> triples, one can use the graph to answer questions about a
missing element. For an example that combines transformers with knowledge graphs,
see the Haystack tutorials. One more promising direction is <i>automatic</i> <i>question</i> <i>gener‐</i>
<i>ation</i> as a way to do some form of unsupervised/weakly supervised training using
unlabeled data or data augmentation. Two recent examples include the papers on the
Probably Answered Questions (PAQ) benchmark and synthetic data augmentation
for cross-lingual settings.18
In this chapter we’ve seen that in order to successfully use QA models for real-world
use cases we need to apply a few tricks, such as implementing a fast retrieval pipeline
to make predictions in near real time. Still, applying a QA model to a handful of pre‐
selected documents can take a couple of seconds on production hardware. Although
this may not sound like much, imagine how different your experience would be if you
had to wait a few seconds to get the results of a Google search—a few seconds of wait
time can decide the fate of your transformer-powered application. In the next chapter
we’ll have a look at a few methods to accelerate model predictions further.
