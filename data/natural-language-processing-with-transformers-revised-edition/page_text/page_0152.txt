We observe that the precision scores are much better. The 1-grams in the prediction
all match, and only in the precision scores do we see that something is off. For the 4-
["the", "cat", "is", "on"] ["cat",
gram there are only two candidates, and
"is", "on", "mat"] , where the last one does not match, hence the precision of 0.5.
The BLEU score is widely used for evaluating text, especially in machine translation,
since precise translations are usually favored over translations that include all possible
and appropriate words.
There are other applications, such as summarization, where the situation is different.
There, we want all the important information in the generated text, so we favor high
recall. This is where the ROUGE score is usually used.

The ROUGE score was specifically developed for applications like summarization
where high recall is more important than just precision.5 The approach is very similar
to the BLEU score in that we look at different <i>n-grams</i> and compare their occurrences
in the generated text and the reference texts. The difference is that with ROUGE we
check how many <i>n-grams</i> in the reference text also occur in the generated text. For
BLEU we looked at how many <i>n-grams</i> in the generated text appear in the reference,
so we can reuse the precision formula with the minor modification that we count
the (unclipped) occurrence of reference <i>n-grams</i> in the generated text in the
denominator:
∑ ∑ <i>Count</i> <i>n‐gram</i>
∈ ∈ ′
snt’ <i>C</i> <i>n‐gram</i> <i>snt</i> <i>match</i>
ROUGE‐N =
∑ ∑ <i>Count</i> <i>n‐gram</i>
snt’ ∈ <i>C</i> <i>n‐gram</i> ∈ <i>snt′</i>
This was the original proposal for ROUGE. Subsequently, researchers have found that
fully removing precision can have strong negative effects. Going back to the BLEU
formula without the clipped counting, we can measure precision as well, and we can
then combine both precision and recall ROUGE scores in the harmonic mean to get
an <i>F</i> -score. This score is the metric that is nowadays commonly reported for
1
ROUGE.
