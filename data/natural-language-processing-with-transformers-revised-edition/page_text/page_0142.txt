summaries are <i>abstractive</i> and not <i>extractive,</i> which means that they consist of new
sentences instead of simple excerpts. The dataset is available on the Hub; we’ll use
version 3.0.0, which is a nonanonymized version set up for summarization. We can
select versions in a similar manner as splits, we saw in Chapter 4, with a version
keyword. So let’s dive in and have a look at it:
<b>from</b> <b>datasets</b> <b>import</b> load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("cnn_dailymail", version="3.0.0")
<b>print(f"Features:</b> {dataset['train'].column_names}")
Features: ['article', 'highlights', 'id']
The dataset has three columns: article , which contains the news articles, high
lights with the summaries, and id to uniquely identify each article. Let’s look at an
excerpt from an article:
sample = dataset["train"][1]
<b>print(f"""</b>
Article (excerpt of 500 characters, total length: {len(sample["article"])}):
""")
<b>print(sample["article"][:500])</b>
<b>print(f'\nSummary</b> (length: {len(sample["highlights"])}):')
<b>print(sample["highlights"])</b>
Article (excerpt of 500 characters, total length: 3192):

We see that the articles can be very long compared to the target summary; in this par‐
ticular case the difference is 17-fold. Long articles pose a challenge to most trans‐
former models since the context size is usually limited to 1,000 tokens or so, which is
equivalent to a few paragraphs of text. The standard, yet crude way to deal with this
for summarization is to simply truncate the texts beyond the model’s context size.
Obviously there could be important information for the summary toward the end of
the text, but for now we need to live with this limitation of the model architectures.
