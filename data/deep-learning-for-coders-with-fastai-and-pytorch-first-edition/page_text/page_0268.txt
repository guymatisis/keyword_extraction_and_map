So, for instance, even if you donâ€™t normally enjoy detective movies, you might enjoy
<i>LA</i> <i>Confidential!</i>
It is not quite so easy to directly interpret the embedding matrices. There are just too
many factors for a human to look at. But there is a technique that can pull out the
most important underlying <i>directions</i> in such a matrix, called <i>principal</i> <i>component</i>
<i>analysis</i> (PCA). We will not be going into this in detail in this book, because it is not
particularly important for you to understand to be a deep learning practitioner, but if
you are interested, we suggest you check out the fast.ai course Computational Linear
Algebra for Coders. Figure 8-3 shows what our movies look like based on two of the
strongest PCA components.

We can see here that the model seems to have discovered a concept of <i>classic</i> versus
<i>pop</i> <i>culture</i> movies, or perhaps it is <i>critically</i> <i>acclaimed</i> that is represented here.
