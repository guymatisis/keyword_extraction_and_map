We’ll discuss four of these types of bias, those that we’ve found most helpful in our
own work (see the paper for details on the others).
<b>Historicalbias</b>
<i>Historical</i> <i>bias</i> comes from the fact that people are biased, processes are biased, and
society is biased. Suresh and Guttag say: “Historical bias is a fundamental, structural
issue with the first step of the data generation process and can exist even given perfect
sampling and feature selection.”
For instance, here are a few examples of historical <i>race</i> <i>bias</i> in the US, from the <i>New</i>
<i>York</i> <i>Times</i> article “Racial Bias, Even When We Have Good Intentions” by the Univer‐
sity of Chicago’s Sendhil Mullainathan:
• When doctors were shown identical files, they were much less likely to recom‐
mend cardiac catheterization (a helpful procedure) to Black patients.
• When bargaining for a used car, Black people were offered initial prices $700
higher and received far smaller concessions.
