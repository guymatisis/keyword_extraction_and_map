Currently, less than 12% of AI researchers are women, according to a study from Ele‐
ment AI. The statistics are similarly dire when it comes to race and age. When every‐
body on a team has similar backgrounds, they are likely to have similar blind spots
around ethical risks. The <i>Harvard</i> <i>Business</i> <i>Review</i> (HBR) has published a number of
studies showing many benefits of diverse teams, including the following:
• “How Diversity Can Drive Innovation”
• “Teams Solve Problems Faster When They’re More Cognitively Diverse”
• “Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter”
• “Defend Your Research: What Makes a Team Smarter? More Women”
Diversity can lead to problems being identified earlier, and a wider range of solutions
being considered. For instance, Tracy Chou was an early engineer at Quora. She
wrote of her experiences, describing how she advocated internally for adding a fea‐
ture that would allow trolls and other bad actors to be blocked. Chou recounts, “I was
eager to work on the feature because I personally felt antagonized and abused on the
site (gender isn’t an unlikely reason as to why)…But if I hadn’t had that personal per‐
spective, it’s possible that the Quora team wouldn’t have prioritized building a block
button so early in its existence.” Harassment often drives people from marginalized
groups off online platforms, so this functionality has been important for maintaining
the health of Quora’s community.
A crucial aspect to understand is that women leave the tech industry at over twice the
rate that men do. According to the Harvard Business Review, 41% of women working
in tech leave, compared to 17% of men. An analysis of over 200 books, whitepapers,
and articles found that the reason they leave is that “they’re treated unfairly; under‐
paid, less likely to be fast-tracked than their male colleagues, and unable to advance.”
Studies have confirmed a number of the factors that make it harder for women to
advance in the workplace. Women receive more vague feedback and personality criti‐
cism in performance evaluations, whereas men receive actionable advice tied to busi‐
ness outcomes (which is more useful). Women frequently experience being excluded
from more creative and innovative roles, and not receiving high-visibility “stretch”
assignments that are helpful in getting promoted. One study found that men’s voices
are perceived as more persuasive, fact-based, and logical than women’s voices, even
when reading identical scripts.
Receiving mentorship has been statistically shown to help men advance, but not
women. The reason behind this is that when women receive mentorship, it’s advice
on how they should change and gain more self-knowledge. When men receive men‐
torship, it’s public endorsement of their authority. Guess which is more useful in get‐
ting promoted?
