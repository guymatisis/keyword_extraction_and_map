Hello, and thank you for letting us join you on your deep learning journey, however
far along that you may be! In this chapter, we will tell you a little bit more about what
to expect in this book, introduce the key concepts behind deep learning, and train our
first models on different tasks. It doesn’t matter if you don’t come from a technical or
a mathematical background (though it’s OK if you do too!); we wrote this book to
make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible.

A lot of people assume that you need all kinds of hard-to-find stuff to get great results
with deep learning, but as you’ll see in this book, those people are wrong. Table 1-1
lists a few things you <i>absolutely</i> <i>don’t</i> <i>need</i> for world-class deep learning.

<i>Deep</i> <i>learning</i> is a computer technique to extract and transform data—with use cases
ranging from human speech recognition to animal imagery classification—by using
multiple layers of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous
layers and progressively refines them. The layers are trained by algorithms that mini‐
mize their errors and improve their accuracy. In this way, the network learns to per‐
form a specified task. We will discuss training algorithms in detail in the next section.
