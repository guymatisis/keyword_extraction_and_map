The other important piece of information that we have to tell fastai is how to get the
labels from the dataset. Computer vision datasets are normally structured in such a
way that the label for an image is part of the filename or path—most commonly the
parent folder name. fastai comes with a number of standardized labeling methods,
and ways to write your own. Here we’re telling fastai to use the is_cat function we
just defined.
Finally, we define the Transforms that we need. A Transform contains code that is
applied automatically during training; fastai includes many predefined Transforms,
and adding new ones is as simple as creating a Python function. There are two kinds:
item_tfms are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel
square), while batch_tfms are applied to a <i>batch</i> of items at a time using the GPU, so
they’re particularly fast (we’ll see many examples of these throughout this book).
Why 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained mod‐
els require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything. If you increase
the size, you’ll often get a model with better results (since it will be able to focus on
more details), but at the price of speed and memory consumption; the opposite is
true if you decrease the size.
<b>Jargon:ClassificationandRegression</b>
<i>Classification</i> and <i>regression</i> have very specific meanings in
machine learning. These are the two main types of model that we
will be investigating in this book. A <i>classification</i> <i>model</i> is one that
attempts to predict a class, or category. That is, it’s predicting from
a number of discrete possibilities, such as “dog” or “cat.” A <i>regres‐</i>
<i>sion</i> <i>model</i> is one that attempts to predict one or more numeric
quantities, such as a temperature or a location. Sometimes people
use the word <i>regression</i> to refer to a particular kind of model called
a <i>linear</i> <i>regression</i> <i>model;</i> this is a bad practice, and we won’t be
using that terminology in this book!
The Pet dataset contains 7,390 pictures of dogs and cats, consisting of 37 breeds. Each
image is labeled using its filename: for instance, the file <i>great_pyrenees_173.jpg</i> is the
173rd example of an image of a Great Pyrenees breed dog in the dataset. The file‐
names start with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter other‐
wise. We have to tell fastai how to get labels from the filenames, which we do by
calling from_name_func (which means that filenames can be extracted using a func‐
x[0].isupper(), True
tion applied to the filename) and passing which evaluates to if
the first letter is uppercase (i.e., it’s a cat).
The most important parameter to mention here is valid_pct=0.2. This tells fastai to
hold out 20% of the data and <i>not</i> <i>use</i> <i>it</i> <i>for</i> <i>training</i> <i>the</i> <i>model</i> <i>at</i> <i>all.</i> This 20% of the
data is called the <i>validation</i> <i>set;</i> the remaining 80% is called the <i>training</i> <i>set.</i> The
