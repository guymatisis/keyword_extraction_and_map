Another example comes from the paper “Malware Classification with Deep Convolu‐
tional Neural Networks” by Mahmoud Kalash et al., which explains that “the malware
binary file is divided into 8-bit sequences which are then converted to equivalent dec‐
imal values. This decimal vector is reshaped and [a] gray-scale image is generated that
represent[s] the malware sample,” in Figure 1-17.

The authors then show “pictures” generated through this process of malware in dif‐
ferent categories, as shown in Figure 1-18.

As you can see, the different types of malware look very distinctive to the human eye.
The model the researchers trained based on this image representation was more
accurate at malware classification than any previous approach shown in the academic
literature. This suggests a good rule of thumb for converting a dataset into an image
representation: if the human eye can recognize categories from the images, then a
deep learning model should be able to do so too.
In general, you’ll find that a small number of general approaches in deep learning can
go a long way, if you’re a bit creative in how you represent your data! You shouldn’t
think of approaches like the ones described here as “hacky workarounds,” because
