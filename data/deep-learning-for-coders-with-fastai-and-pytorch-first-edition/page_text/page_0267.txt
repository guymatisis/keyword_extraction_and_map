Now, let’s take a look at what our model has learned.
<header><largefont><b>Interpreting</b></largefont> <largefont><b>Embeddings</b></largefont> <largefont><b>and</b></largefont> <largefont><b>Biases</b></largefont></header>
Our model is already useful, in that it can provide us with movie recommendations
for our users—but it is also interesting to see what parameters it has discovered. The
easiest to interpret are the biases. Here are the movies with the lowest values in the
bias vector:
movie_bias = learn.model.movie_bias.squeeze()
idxs = movie_bias.argsort()[:5]
[dls.classes['title'][i] <b>for</b> i <b>in</b> idxs]
['Children of the Corn: The Gathering (1996)',
'Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace (1996)',
'Beautician and the Beast, The (1997)',
'Crow: City of Angels, The (1996)',
'Home Alone 3 (1997)']
Think about what this means. What it’s saying is that for each of these movies, even
when a user is very well matched to its latent factors (which, as we will see in a
moment, tend to represent things like level of action, age of movie, and so forth), they
still generally don’t like it. We could have simply sorted the movies directly by their
average rating, but looking at the learned bias tells us something much more interest‐
ing. It tells us not just whether a movie is of a kind that people tend not to enjoy
watching, but that people tend to not like watching it even if it is of a kind that they
would otherwise enjoy! By the same token, here are the movies with the highest bias:
idxs = movie_bias.argsort(descending=True)[:5]
[dls.classes['title'][i] <b>for</b> i <b>in</b> idxs]
['L.A. Confidential (1997)',
'Titanic (1997)',
'Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)',
'Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)',
'Star Wars (1977)']
