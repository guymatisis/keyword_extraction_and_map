1. Create your own implementation of Learner from scratch, based on the training
loop shown in this chapter.
2. Complete all the steps in this chapter using the full MNIST datasets (for all digits,
not just 3s and 7s). This is a significant project and will take you quite a bit of
time to complete! You’ll need to do some of your own research to figure out how
