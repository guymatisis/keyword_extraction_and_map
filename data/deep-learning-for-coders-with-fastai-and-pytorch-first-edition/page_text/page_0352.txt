We are already starting to see examples of machine learning being used to generate
identities. For example, Figure 10-4 shows a LinkedIn profile for Katie Jones.
<i>Figure</i> <i>10-4.</i> <i>Katie</i> <i>Jones’s</i> <i>LinkedIn</i> <i>profile</i>
Katie Jones was connected on LinkedIn to several members of mainstream Washing‐
ton think tanks. But she didn’t exist. That image you see was autogenerated by a gen‐
erative adversarial network, and somebody named Katie Jones has not, in fact,
graduated from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Many people assume or hope that algorithms will come to our defense here—that we
will develop classification algorithms that can automatically recognize autogenerated
content. The problem, however, is that this will always be an arms race, in which bet‐
ter classification (or discriminator) algorithms can be used to create better generation
algorithms.

In this chapter, we explored the last application covered out of the box by the fastai
library: text. We saw two types of models: language models that can generate texts,
and a classifier that determines whether a review is positive or negative. To build a
state-of-the art classifier, we used a pretrained language model, fine-tuned it to the
corpus of our task, then used its body (the encoder) with a new head to do the
classification.
Before we end this part of the book, we’ll take a look at how the fastai library can help
you assemble your data for your specific problems.
