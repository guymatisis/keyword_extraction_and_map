We can change our weight by a little in the direction of the slope, calculate our loss
and adjustment again, and repeat this a few times. Eventually, we will get to the lowest
point on our curve:
This basic idea goes all the way back to Isaac Newton, who pointed out that we can
optimize arbitrary functions in this way. Regardless of how complicated our functions
become, this basic approach of gradient descent will not significantly change. The
only minor changes we will see later in this book are some handy ways we can make it
faster, by finding better steps.

The one magic step is the bit where we calculate the gradients. As we mentioned, we
use calculus as a performance optimization; it allows us to more quickly calculate
whether our loss will go up or down when we adjust our parameters up or down. In
other words, the gradients will tell us how much we have to change each weight to
make our model better.
You may remember from your high school calculus class that the <i>derivative</i> of a func‐
tion tells you how much a change in its parameters will change its result. If not, don’t
worry; lots of us forget calculus once high school is behind us! But you will need
some intuitive understanding of what a derivative is before you continue, so if this is
all very fuzzy in your head, head over to Khan Academy and complete the lessons on
basic derivatives. You won’t have to know how to calculate them yourself; you just
have to know what a derivative is.
The key point about a derivative is this: for any function, such as the quadratic func‐
tion we saw in the previous section, we can calculate its derivative. The derivative is
another function. It calculates the change, rather than the value. For instance, the
derivative of the quadratic function at the value 3 tells us how rapidly the function
changes at the value 3. More specifically, you may recall that gradient is defined as
<i>rise/run;</i> that is, the change in the value of the function, divided by the change in the
