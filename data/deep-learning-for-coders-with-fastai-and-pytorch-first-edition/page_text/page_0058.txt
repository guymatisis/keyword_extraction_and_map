timating the constraints might mean that you fail to consider and react to important
issues.
The best thing to do is to keep an open mind. If you remain open to the possibility
that deep learning might solve part of your problem with less data or complexity than
you expect, you can design a process through which you can find the specific capabil‐
ities and constraints related to your particular problem. This doesn’t mean making
any risky bets—we will show you how you can gradually roll out models so that they
don’t create significant risks, and can even backtest them prior to putting them in
production.

So where should you start your deep learning journey? The most important thing is
to ensure that you have a project to work on—it is only through working on your
own projects that you will get real experience building and using models. When
selecting a project, the most important consideration is data availability.
Regardless of whether you are doing a project just for your own learning or for prac‐
tical application in your organization, you want to be able to start quickly. We have
seen many students, researchers, and industry practitioners waste months or years
while they attempt to find their perfect dataset. The goal is not to find the “perfect”
dataset or project, but just to get started and iterate from there. If you take this
approach, you will be on your third iteration of learning and improving while the
perfectionists are still in the planning stages!
We also suggest that you iterate from end to end in your project; don’t spend months
fine-tuning your model, or polishing the perfect GUI, or labeling the perfect dataset.
…Instead, complete every step as well as you can in a reasonable amount of time, all
the way to the end. For instance, if your final goal is an application that runs on a
mobile phone, that should be what you have after each iteration. But perhaps in the
early iterations you take shortcuts; for instance, by doing all of the processing on a
remote server and using a simple responsive web application. By completing the
project end to end, you will see where the trickiest bits are, and which bits make the
biggest difference to the final result.
As you work through this book, we suggest that you complete lots of small experi‐
ments, by running and adjusting the notebooks we provide, at the same time that you
gradually develop your own projects. That way, you will be getting experience with all
of the tools and techniques that we’re explaining as we discuss them.
