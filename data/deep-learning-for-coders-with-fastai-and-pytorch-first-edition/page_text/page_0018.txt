You will probably not see exactly the same results shown here. A lot of sources of
small random variation are involved in training models. We generally see an error
rate of well less than 0.02 in this example, however.
<b>TrainingTime</b>
Depending on your network speed, it might take a few minutes to
download the pretrained model and dataset. Running fine_tune
might take a minute or so. Often models in this book take a few
minutes to train, as will your own models, so it’s a good idea to
come up with good techniques to make the most of this time. For
instance, keep reading the next section while your model trains, or
open up another notebook and use it for some coding experiments.

We wrote this book using Jupyter notebooks, so for nearly every chart, table, and cal‐
culation in this book, we’ll be showing you the exact code required to replicate it
yourself. That’s why very often in this book, you will see some code immediately fol‐
lowed by a table, a picture, or just some text. If you go on the book’s website, you will
find all the code, and you can try running and modifying every example yourself.
You just saw how a cell that outputs a table looks in the book. Here is an example of a
cell that outputs text:
1+1
2
Jupyter will always print or show the result of the last line (if there is one). For
instance, here is an example of a cell that outputs an image:
img = PILImage.create('images/chapter1_cat_example.jpg')
img.to_thumb(192)
