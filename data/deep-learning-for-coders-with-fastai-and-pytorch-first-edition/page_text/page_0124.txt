To look at what can cause companies to take concrete action, consider the following
two examples of how Facebook has behaved. In 2018, a UN investigation found that
Facebook had played a “determining role” in the ongoing genocide of the Rohingya,
an ethnic minority in Mynamar described by UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres as “one of, if not the, most discriminated people in the world.” Local activists
had been warning Facebook executives that their platform was being used to spread
hate speech and incite violence since as early as 2013. In 2015, they were warned that
Facebook could play the same role in Myanmar that the radio broadcasts played dur‐
ing the Rwandan genocide (where a million people were killed). Yet, by the end of
2015, Facebook employed only four contractors who spoke Burmese. As one person
close to the matter said, “That’s not 20/20 hindsight. The scale of this problem was
significant and it was already apparent.” Zuckerberg promised during the congres‐
sional hearings to hire “dozens” to address the genocide in Myanmar (in 2018, years
after the genocide had begun, including the destruction by fire of at least 288 villages
in northern Rakhine state after August 2017).
This stands in stark contrast to Facebook quickly hiring 1,200 people in Germany to
try to avoid expensive penalties (of up to 50 million euros) under a new German law
against hate speech. Clearly, in this case, Facebook was more reactive to the threat of a
financial penalty than to the systematic destruction of an ethnic minority.
In an article on privacy issues, Maciej Ceglowski draws parallels with the environ‐
mental movement:
This regulatory project has been so successful in the First World that we risk forgetting
what life was like before it. Choking smog of the kind that today kills thousands in
Jakarta and Delhi was once emblematic of London. The Cuyahoga River in Ohio used
to reliably catch fire. In a particularly horrific example of unforeseen consequences,
tetraethyl lead added to gasoline raised violent crime rates worldwide for fifty years.
None of these harms could have been fixed by telling people to vote with their wallet,
or carefully review the environmental policies of every company they gave their busi‐
ness to, or to stop using the technologies in question. It took coordinated, and some‐
times highly technical, regulation across jurisdictional boundaries to fix them. In some
cases, like the ban on commercial refrigerants that depleted the ozone layer, that regu‐
lation required a worldwide consensus. We’re at the point where we need a similar shift
in perspective in our privacy law.

Clean air and clean drinking water are public goods that are nearly impossible to pro‐
tect through individual market decisions, but rather require coordinated regulatory
action. Similarly, many of the harms resulting from unintended consequences of
misuses of technology involve public goods, such as a polluted information environ‐
ment or deteriorated ambient privacy. Too often privacy is framed as an individual
