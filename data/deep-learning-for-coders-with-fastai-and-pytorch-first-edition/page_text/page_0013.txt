By the end of the book, you’ll understand nearly all the code that’s inside fastai (and
much of PyTorch too), because in each chapter we’ll be digging a level deeper to show
you exactly what’s going on as we build and train our models. This means that you’ll
have learned the most important best practices used in modern deep learning—not
just how to use them, but how they really work and are implemented. If you want to
use those approaches in another framework, you’ll have the knowledge you need to
do so if needed.
Since the most important thing for learning deep learning is writing code and experi‐
menting, it’s important that you have a great platform for experimenting with code.
The most popular programming experimentation platform is called Jupyter. This is
what we will be using throughout this book. We will show you how you can use
Jupyter to train and experiment with models and introspect every stage of the data
preprocessing and model development pipeline. Jupyter is the most popular tool for
doing data science in Python, for good reason. It is powerful, flexible, and easy to use.

Let’s see it in practice and train our first model.

As we said before, we will teach you how to do things before we explain why they
work. Following this top-down approach, we will begin by actually training an image
classifier to recognize dogs and cats with almost 100% accuracy. To train this model
and run our experiments, you will need to do some initial setup. Don’t worry; it’s not
as hard as it looks.

Do not skip the setup part even if it looks intimidating at first,
especially if you have little or no experience using things like a ter‐
minal or the command line. Most of that is not necessary, and you
will find that the easiest servers can be set up with just your usual
web browser. It is crucial that you run your own experiments in
parallel with this book in order to learn.
