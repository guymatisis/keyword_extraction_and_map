The percentage of nonzero weights is getting much better, although it’s still quite
high. We can see even more about what’s going on in our training by using
color_dim, passing it a layer index:
learn.activation_stats.color_dim(-2)
color_dim was developed by fast.ai in conjunction with a student, Stefano Giomo.
Giomo, who refers to the idea as the <i>colorful</i> <i>dimension,</i> provides an in-depth explan‐
ation of the history and details behind the method. The basic idea is to create a histo‐
gram of the activations of a layer, which we would hope would follow a smooth
pattern such as the normal distribution (Figure 13-14).
