1. Use the mid-level API to prepare the data in DataLoaders on your own datasets.
Try this with the Pet dataset and the Adult dataset from Chapter 1.
2. Look at the Siamese tutorial in the fastai documentation to learn how to custom‐
ize the behavior of show_batch and show_results for new types of items. Imple‐
ment it in your own project.

Congratulations—you’ve completed all of the chapters in this book that cover the key
practical parts of training models and using deep learning! You know how to use all
of fastai’s built-in applications, and how to customize them using the data block API
and loss functions. You even know how to create a neural network from scratch and
train it! (And hopefully you now know some of the questions to ask to make sure
your creations help improve society too.)
The knowledge you already have is enough to create full working prototypes of many
types of neural network application. More importantly, it will help you understand
the capabilities and limitations of deep learning models, and how to design a system
that’s well adapted to them.
In the rest of this book, we will be pulling apart those applications, piece by piece, to
understand the foundations they are built on. This is important knowledge for a deep
learning practitioner, because it allows you to inspect and debug models that you
build and to create new applications that are customized for your particular projects.
