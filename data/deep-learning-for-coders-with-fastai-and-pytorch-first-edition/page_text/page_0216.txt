1. Why do we first resize to a large size on the CPU, and then to a smaller size on
the GPU?
2. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, find a regular expression tutorial
and some problem sets, and complete them. Have a look on the book’s website
for suggestions.
3. What are the two ways in which data is most commonly provided for most deep
learning datasets?
4. Look up the documentation for L and try using a few of the new methods that it
adds.
5. Look up the documentation for the Python pathlib module and try using a few
methods of the Path class.
6. Give two examples of ways that image transformations can degrade the quality of
the data.
7. What method does fastai provide to view the data in a DataLoaders?
8. What method does fastai provide to help you debug a DataBlock?
9. Should you hold off on training a model until you have thoroughly cleaned your
data?
10. What are the two pieces that are combined into cross-entropy loss in PyTorch?
11. What are the two properties of activations that softmax ensures? Why is this
important?
12. When might you want your activations to not have these two properties?
13. Calculate the exp and softmax columns of Figure 5-3 yourself (i.e., in a spread‐
sheet, with a calculator, or in a notebook).
14. Why can’t we use torch.where to create a loss function for datasets where our
label can have more than two categories?
15. What is the value of log(–2)? Why?
16. What are two good rules of thumb for picking a learning rate from the learning
rate finder?
17. What two steps does the fine_tune method do?
18. In Jupyter Notebook, how do you get the source code for a method or function?
19. What are discriminative learning rates?
20. How is a Python slice object interpreted when passed as a learning rate to
fastai?
