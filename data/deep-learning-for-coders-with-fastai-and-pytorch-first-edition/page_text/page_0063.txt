of combining all of these types of information with additional metadata represented
as tables, such as user information, previous transactions, and so forth.
However, nearly all machine learning approaches have the downside that they tell you
only which products a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations
would be helpful for a user. Many kinds of recommendations for products a user
might like may not be at all helpful—for instance, if the user is already familiar with
the products, or if they are simply different packagings of products they have already
purchased (such as a boxed set of novels, when they already have each of the items in
that set). Jeremy likes reading books by Terry Pratchett, and for a while Amazon was
recommending nothing but Terry Pratchett books to him (see Figure 2-1), which
really wasn’t helpful because he was already aware of these books!

Often you will find that domain-specific data types fit very nicely into existing cate‐
gories. For instance, protein chains look a lot like natural language documents, in that
they are long sequences of discrete tokens with complex relationships and meaning
throughout the sequence. And indeed, it does turn out that using NLP deep learning
methods is the current state-of-the-art approach for many types of protein analysis.
As another example, sounds can be represented as spectrograms, which can be
treated as images; standard deep learning approaches for images turn out to work
really well on spectrograms.

Many accurate models are of no use to anyone, and many inaccurate models are
highly useful. To ensure that your modeling work is useful in practice, you need to
consider how your work will be used. In 2012, Jeremy, along with Margit Zwemer and
Mike Loukides, introduced a method called <i>the</i> <i>Drivetrain</i> <i>Approach</i> for thinking
about this issue.
