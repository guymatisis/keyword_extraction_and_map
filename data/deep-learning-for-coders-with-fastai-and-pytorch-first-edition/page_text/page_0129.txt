Make sure that you have completed the following steps:
1. Connect to one of the GPU Jupyter servers recommended on the book’s website.
2. Run the first notebook yourself.
3. Upload an image that you find in the first notebook; then try a few images of dif‐
ferent kinds to see what happens.
4. Run the second notebook, collecting your own dataset based on image search
queries that you come up with.
5. Think about how you can use deep learning to help you with your own projects,
including what kinds of data you could use, what kinds of problems may come
up, and how you might be able to mitigate these issues in practice.
In the next section of the book, you will learn about how and why deep learning
works, instead of just seeing how you can use it in practice. Understanding the how
and why is important for both practitioners and researchers, because in this fairly
new field, nearly every project requires some level of customization and debugging.
The better you understand the foundations of deep learning, the better your models
will be. These foundations are less important for executives, product managers, and
so forth (although still useful, so feel free to keep reading!), but they are critical for
anybody who is training and deploying models themselves.
