The Drivetrain Approach, illustrated in Figure 2-2, was described in detail in
“Designing Great Data Products”. The basic idea is to start with considering your
objective, then think about what actions you can take to meet that objective and what
data you have (or can acquire) that can help, and then build a model that you can use
to determine the best actions to take to get the best results in terms of your objective.
<i>Figure</i> <i>2-2.</i> <i>The</i> <i>Drivetrain</i> <i>Approach</i>
Consider a model in an autonomous vehicle: you want to help a car drive safely from
point A to point B without human intervention. Great predictive modeling is an
important part of the solution, but it doesn’t stand on its own; as products become
more sophisticated, it disappears into the plumbing. Someone using a self-driving car
is completely unaware of the hundreds (if not thousands) of models and the petabytes
of data that make it work. But as data scientists build increasingly sophisticated prod‐
ucts, they need a systematic design approach.
We use data not just to generate more data (in the form of predictions), but to pro‐
duce <i>actionable</i> <i>outcomes.</i> That is the goal of the Drivetrain Approach. Start by defin‐
ing a clear <i>objective.</i> For instance, Google, when creating its first search engine,
considered “What is the user’s main objective in typing in a search query?” This led
to Google’s objective, which was to “show the most relevant search result.” The next
step is to consider what <i>levers</i> you can pull (i.e., what actions you can take) to better
achieve that objective. In Google’s case, that was the ranking of the search results. The
third step was to consider what new <i>data</i> they would need to produce such a ranking;
they realized that the implicit information regarding which pages linked to which
other pages could be used for this purpose.
Only after these first three steps do we begin thinking about building the predictive
<i>models.</i> Our objective and available levers, what data we already have and what addi‐
tional data we will need to collect, determine the models we can build. The models
will take both the levers and any uncontrollable variables as their inputs; the outputs
from the models can be combined to predict the final state for our objective.
