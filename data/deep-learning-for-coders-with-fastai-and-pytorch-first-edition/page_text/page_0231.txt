We can now use this approach to find the best threshold level:
xs = torch.linspace(0.05,0.95,29)
accs = [accuracy_multi(preds, targs, thresh=i, sigmoid=False) <b>for</b> i <b>in</b> xs]
plt.plot(xs,accs);
In this case, we’re using the validation set to pick a hyperparameter (the threshold),
which is the purpose of the validation set. Sometimes students have expressed their
concern that we might be <i>overfitting</i> to the validation set, since we’re trying lots of
values to see which is the best. However, as you see in the plot, changing the thres‐
hold in this case results in a smooth curve, so we’re clearly not picking an inappropri‐
ate outlier. This is a good example of where you have to be careful of the difference
between theory (don’t try lots of hyperparameter values or you might overfit the vali‐
dation set) versus practice (if the relationship is smooth, it’s fine to do this).
This concludes the part of this chapter dedicated to multi-label classification. Next,
we’ll take a look at a regression problem.

It’s easy to think of deep learning models as being classified into domains, like <i>com‐</i>
<i>puter</i> <i>vision,</i> <i>NLP,</i> and so forth. And indeed, that’s how fastai classifies its applications
—largely because that’s how most people are used to thinking of things.
But really, that’s hiding a more interesting and deeper perspective. A model is defined
by its independent and dependent variables, along with its loss function. That means
that there’s really a far wider array of models than just the simple domain-based split.
Perhaps we have an independent variable that’s an image, and a dependent that’s text
(e.g., generating a caption from an image); or perhaps we have an independent vari‐
able that’s text and a dependent that’s an image (e.g., generating an image from a cap‐
tion—which is actually possible for deep learning to do!); or perhaps we’ve got
images, texts, and tabular data as independent variables, and we’re trying to predict
product purchases…the possibilities really are endless.
