This gives us all of the functions and classes we will need to create a wide variety of
computer vision models.

A lot of Python coders recommend avoiding importing a whole
import *
library like this (using the syntax) because in large soft‐
ware projects it can cause problems. However, for interactive work
such as in a Jupyter notebook, it works great. The fastai library is
specially designed to support this kind of interactive use, and it will
import only the necessary pieces into your environment.
The second line downloads a standard dataset from the fast.ai datasets collection (if
not previously downloaded) to your server, extracts it (if not previously extracted),
and returns a Path object with the extracted location:
path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'

Throughout my time studying at fast.ai, and even still today, I’ve
learned a lot about productive coding practices. The fastai library
and fast.ai notebooks are full of great little tips that have helped
make me a better programmer. For instance, notice that the fastai
library doesn’t just return a string containing the path to the data‐
set, but a Path object. This is a really useful class from the Python 3
standard library that makes accessing files and directories much
easier. If you haven’t come across it before, be sure to check out its
documentation or a tutorial and try it out. Note that the book’s
website contains links to recommended tutorials for each chapter.
I’ll keep letting you know about little coding tips I’ve found useful
as we come across them.
In the third line, we define a function, is_cat , that labels cats based on a filename
rule provided by the dataset’s creators:
<b>def</b> is_cat(x): <b>return</b> x[0].isupper()
We use that function in the fourth line, which tells fastai what kind of dataset we have
and how it is structured:
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(
path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,
label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))
There are various classes for different kinds of deep learning datasets and problems—
here we’re using ImageDataLoaders. The first part of the class name will generally be
the type of data you have, such as image or text.
