that we need to act to make digital signatures de rigueur as a means of authentication
of digital content.”
While we can’t hope to discuss all the ethical issues that deep learning, and algorithms
more generally, bring up, hopefully this brief introduction has been a useful starting
point you can build on. We’ll now move on to the questions of how to identify ethical
issues and what to do about them.

Mistakes happen. Finding out about them, and dealing with them, needs to be part of
the design of any system that includes machine learning (and many other systems
too). The issues raised within data ethics are often complex and interdisciplinary, but
it is crucial that we work to address them.
So what can we do? This is a big topic, but here are a few steps toward addressing
ethical issues:
• Analyze a project you are working on.
• Implement processes at your company to find and address ethical risks.
• Support good policy.
• Increase diversity.
Let’s walk through each step, starting with analyzing a project you are working on.

It’s easy to miss important issues when considering ethical implications of your work.
One thing that helps enormously is simply asking the right questions. Rachel Thomas
recommends considering the following questions throughout the development of a
data project:
• Should we even be doing this?
• What bias is in the data?
• Can the code and data be audited?
• What are the error rates for different subgroups?
• What is the accuracy of a simple rule-based alternative?
• What processes are in place to handle appeals or mistakes?
• How diverse is the team that built it?
