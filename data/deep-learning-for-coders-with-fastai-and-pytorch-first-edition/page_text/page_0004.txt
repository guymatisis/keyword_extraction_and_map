Deep learning has power, flexibility, and simplicity. That’s why we believe it should be
applied across many disciplines. These include the social and physical sciences, the
arts, medicine, finance, scientific research, and many more. To give a personal exam‐
ple, despite having no background in medicine, Jeremy started Enlitic, a company
that uses deep learning algorithms to diagnose illness and disease. Within months of
starting the company, it was announced that its algorithm could identify malignant
tumors more accurately than radiologists.
Here’s a list of some of the thousands of tasks in different areas for which deep learn‐
ing, or methods heavily using deep learning, is now the best in the world:
<i>Natural</i> <i>language</i> <i>processing</i> <i>(NLP)</i>
Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying
documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles men‐
tioning a concept
<i>Computer</i> <i>vision</i>
Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience), face rec‐
ognition, image captioning, reading traffic signs, locating pedestrians and vehi‐
cles in autonomous vehicles
<i>Medicine</i>
Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images;
counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diag‐
nosing diabetic retinopathy
<i>Biology</i>
Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-
normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell
classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
<i>Image</i> <i>generation</i>
Colorizing images, increasing image resolution, removing noise from images,
converting images to art in the style of famous artists
<i>Recommendation</i> <i>systems</i>
Web search, product recommendations, home page layout
<i>Playing</i> <i>games</i>
Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
<i>Robotics</i>
Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking
texture) or hard to pick up
<i>Other</i> <i>applications</i>
Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much, much more…
