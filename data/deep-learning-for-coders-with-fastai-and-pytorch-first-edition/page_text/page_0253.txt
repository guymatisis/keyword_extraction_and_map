One common problem to solve is having a number of users and a number of prod‐
ucts, and you want to recommend which products are most likely to be useful for
which users. Many variations exist: for example, recommending movies (such as on
Netflix), figuring out what to highlight for a user on a home page, deciding what sto‐
ries to show in a social media feed, and so forth. A general solution to this problem,
called <i>collaborative</i> <i>filtering,</i> works like this: look at which products the current user
has used or liked, find other users who have used or liked similar products, and then
recommend other products that those users have used or liked.
For example, on Netflix, you may have watched lots of movies that are science fiction,
full of action, and were made in the 1970s. Netflix may not know these particular
properties of the films you have watched, but it will be able to see that other people
who have watched the same movies that you watched also tended to watch other
movies that are science fiction, full of action, and were made in the 1970s. In other
words, to use this approach, we don’t necessarily need to know anything about the
movies except who likes to watch them.
There is a more general class of problems that this approach can solve, not necessarily
involving users and products. Indeed, for collaborative filtering, we more commonly
refer to <i>items,</i> rather than <i>products.</i> Items could be links that people click, diagnoses
that are selected for patients, and so forth.
The key foundational idea is that of <i>latent</i> <i>factors.</i> In the Netflix example, we started
with the assumption that you like old, action-packed sci-fi movies. But you never told
Netflix that you like these kinds of movies. And Netflix never needed to add columns
to its movies table saying which movies are of these types. Still, there must be some
underlying concept of sci-fi, action, and movie age, and these concepts must be rele‐
vant for at least some people’s movie-watching decisions.
