15. Try to run each line of TabularModel.forward separately, one line per cell, in a
notebook, and look at the input and output shapes at each step.
16. How is self.layers defined in TabularModel ?
17. What are the five steps for preventing overfitting?
18. Why don’t we reduce architecture complexity before trying other approaches to
preventing overfitting?

1. Write your own custom head and try training the pet recognizer with it. See if
you can get a better result than fastai’s default.
2. Try switching between AdaptiveConcatPool2d and AdaptiveAvgPool2d in a
CNN head and see what difference it makes.
3. Write your own custom splitter to create a separate parameter group for every
ResNet block, and a separate group for the stem. Try training with it, and see if it
improves the pet recognizer.
4. Read the online chapter about generative image models, and create your own col‐
orizer, super-resolution model, or style transfer model.
5. Create a custom head using nearest neighbor interpolation and use it to do seg‐
mentation on CamVid.
