5. Read the paper “Does Machine Learning Automate Moral Hazard and Error?”
What actions do you think should be taken to deal with the issues identified in

Congratulations! You’ve made it to the end of the first section of the book. In this sec‐
tion, we’ve tried to show you what deep learning can do, and how you can use it to
create real applications and products. At this point, you will get a lot more out of the
book if you spend some time trying out what you’ve learned. Perhaps you have
already been doing this as you go along—in which case, great! If not, that’s no prob‐
lem either—now is a great time to start experimenting yourself.
If you haven’t been to the book’s website yet, head over there now. It’s really important
that you get yourself set up to run the notebooks. Becoming an effective deep learn‐
ing practitioner is all about practice, so you need to be training models. So, please go
get the notebooks running now if you haven’t already! And have a look on the website
for any important updates or notices; deep learning changes fast, and we can’t change
the words that are printed in this book, so the website is where you need to look to
ensure you have the most up-to-date information.
