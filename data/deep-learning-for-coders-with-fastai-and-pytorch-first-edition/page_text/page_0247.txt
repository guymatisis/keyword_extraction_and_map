We’re going to be looking at more and more research papers from here on in the
book. Now that you have the basic jargon, you might be surprised to discover how
much of them you can understand, with a little practice! One issue you’ll notice is
that Greek letters, such as <i>λ,</i> appear in most papers. It’s a good idea to learn the names
of all the Greek letters, since otherwise it’s hard to read the papers to yourself and
remember them (or to read code based on them, since code often uses the names of
the Greek letters spelled out, such as lambda).
The bigger issue with papers is that they use math, instead of code, to explain what’s
going on. If you don’t have much of a math background, this will likely be intimidat‐
ing and confusing at first. But remember: what is being shown in the math is some‐
thing that will be implemented in code. It’s just another way of talking about the same
thing! After reading a few papers, you’ll pick up more and more of the notation. If
you don’t know what a symbol is, try looking it up in Wikipedia’s list of mathematical
symbols or drawing it in Detexify, which (using machine learning!) will find the
name of your hand-drawn symbol. Then you can search online for that name to find
out what it’s for.
Figure 7-2 shows what it looks like when we take a <i>linear</i> <i>combination</i> of images, as
done in Mixup.
