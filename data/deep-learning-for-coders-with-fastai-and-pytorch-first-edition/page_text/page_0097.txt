their models will be used, and consider how to best ensure that they are used as posi‐

One particularly hideous example of what happens when technologists focus on tech‐

But this was not an isolated incident—the organization’s involvement was extensive.
IBM and its subsidiaries provided regular training and maintenance onsite at the
concentration camps: printing off cards, configuring machines, and repairing them as
