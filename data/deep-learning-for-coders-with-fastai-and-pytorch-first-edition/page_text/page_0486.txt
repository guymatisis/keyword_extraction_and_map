data
The underlying DataLoaders.
loss_func
The loss function used.
opt
The optimizer used to update the model parameters.
opt_func
The function used to create the optimizer.
cbs
The list containing all the Callbacks.
dl
The current DataLoader used for iteration.
x/xb
The last input drawn from self.dl (potentially modified by callbacks). xb is
always a tuple (potentially with one element), and x is detuplified. You can assign
only to xb.
y/yb
The last target drawn from self.dl (potentially modified by callbacks). yb is
always a tuple (potentially with one element), and y is detuplified. You can assign
only to yb .
pred
The last predictions from self.model (potentially modified by callbacks).
loss
The last computed loss (potentially modified by callbacks).
n_epoch
The number of epochs in this training.
n_iter
The number of iterations in the current self.dl.
epoch
The current epoch index (from 0 to n_epoch-1 ).
iter
The current iteration index in self.dl (from 0 to n_iter-1).
