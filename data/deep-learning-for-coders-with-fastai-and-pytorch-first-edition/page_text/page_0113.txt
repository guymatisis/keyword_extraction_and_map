• Cardiovascular disease
• Accidental injury
• Benign breast lump
• Colonoscopy
• Sinusitis
However, only the top two have anything to do with a stroke! Based on what we’ve
studied so far, you can probably guess why. We haven’t really measured <i>stroke,</i> which
occurs when a region of the brain is denied oxygen due to an interruption in the
blood supply. What we’ve measured is who had symptoms, went to a doctor, got the
appropriate tests, <i>and</i> received a diagnosis of stroke. Actually having a stroke is not
the only thing correlated with this complete list—it’s also correlated with being the
kind of person who goes to the doctor (which is influenced by who has access to
healthcare, can afford their co-pay, doesn’t experience racial or gender-based medical
discrimination, and more)! If you are likely to go to the doctor for an <i>accidental</i>
<i>injury,</i> you are likely to also go the doctor when you are having a stroke.
This is an example of <i>measurement</i> <i>bias.</i> It occurs when our models make mistakes
because we are measuring the wrong thing, or measuring it in the wrong way, or
incorporating that measurement into the model inappropriately.
<b>Aggregationbias</b>
<i>Aggregation</i> <i>bias</i> occurs when models do not aggregate data in a way that incorporates
all of the appropriate factors, or when a model does not include the necessary interac‐
tion terms, nonlinearities, or so forth. This can particularly occur in medical settings.
For instance, the way diabetes is treated is often based on simple univariate statistics
and studies involving small groups of heterogeneous people. Analysis of results is
often done in a way that does not take into account different ethnicities or genders.
However, it turns out that diabetes patients have different complications across eth‐
nicities, and HbA1c levels (widely used to diagnose and monitor diabetes) differ in
complex ways across ethnicities and genders. This can result in people being misdiag‐
nosed or incorrectly treated because medical decisions are based on a model that does
not include these important variables and interactions.
<b>Representationbias</b>
The abstract of the paper “Bias in Bios: A Case Study of Semantic Representation Bias
in a High-Stakes Setting” by Maria De-Arteaga et al. notes that there is gender imbal‐
ance in occupations (e.g., females are more likely to be nurses, and males are more
likely to be pastors), and says that “differences in true positive rates between genders
are correlated with existing gender imbalances in occupations, which may compound
these imbalances.”
