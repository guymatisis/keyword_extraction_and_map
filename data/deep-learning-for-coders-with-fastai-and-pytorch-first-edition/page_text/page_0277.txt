Tabular modeling takes data in the form of a table (like a spreadsheet or CSV). The
objective is to predict the value in one column based on the values in the other col‐
umns. In this chapter, we will look at not only deep learning, but also more general
machine learning techniques like random forests, as they can give better results
depending on your problem.
We will look at how we should preprocess and clean the data as well as how to inter‐
pret the result of our models after training, but first we will see how we can feed col‐
umns that contain categories into a model that expects numbers by using
embeddings.

In tabular data, some columns may contain numerical data, like “age,” while others
contain string values, like “sex.” The numerical data can be directly fed to the model
(with some optional preprocessing), but the other columns need to be converted to
numbers. Since the values in those correspond to different categories, we often call
this type of variables <i>categorical</i> <i>variables.</i> The first type are called <i>continuous</i>
<i>variables.</i>
<b>Jargon:ContinuousandCategoricalVariables</b>
Continuous variables are numerical data, such as “age,” that can be
directly fed to the model, since you can add and multiply them
directly. Categorical variables contain a number of discrete levels,
such as “movie ID,” for which addition and multiplication don’t
have meaning (even if they’re stored as numbers).
