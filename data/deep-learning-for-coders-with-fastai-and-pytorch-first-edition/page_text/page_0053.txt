For example, Kaggle had a competition to predict the sales in a chain of Ecuadorian
grocery stores. Kaggle’s training data ran from Jan 1, 2013 to Aug 15, 2017, and the
test data spanned from Aug 16, 2017 to Aug 31, 2017. That way, the competition
organizer ensured that entrants were making predictions for a time period that was <i>in</i>
<i>the</i> <i>future,</i> from the perspective of their model. This is similar to the way quantitative
hedge fund traders do <i>backtesting</i> to check whether their models are predictive of
future periods, based on past data.
A second common case occurs when you can easily anticipate ways the data you will
be making predictions for in production may be <i>qualitatively</i> <i>different</i> from the data
you have to train your model with.
In the Kaggle distracted driver competition, the independent variables are pictures of
drivers at the wheel of a car, and the dependent variables are categories such as text‐
ing, eating, or safely looking ahead. Lots of pictures are of the same drivers in differ‐
ent positions, as we can see in Figure 1-22. If you were an insurance company
building a model from this data, note that you would be most interested in how the
model performs on drivers it hasn’t seen before (since you would likely have training
data for only a small group of people). In recognition of this, the test data for the
competition consists of images of people that don’t appear in the training set.

If you put one of the images in Figure 1-22 in your training set and one in the valida‐
tion set, your model will have an easy time making a prediction for the one in the
validation set, so it will seem to be performing better than it would on new people.
Another perspective is that if you used all the people in training your model, your
model might be overfitting to particularities of those specific people and not just
learning the states (texting, eating, etc.).
A similar dynamic was at work in the Kaggle fisheries competition to identify the spe‐
cies of fish caught by fishing boats in order to reduce illegal fishing of endangered
populations. The test set consisted of images from boats that didn’t appear in the
