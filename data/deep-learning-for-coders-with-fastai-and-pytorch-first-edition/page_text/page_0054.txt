training data, so in this case you’d want your validation set to also include boats that
are not in the training set.
Sometimes it may not be clear how your validation data will differ. For instance, for a
problem using satellite imagery, you’d need to gather more information on whether
the training set contained just certain geographic locations or came from geographi‐
cally scattered data.
Now that you have gotten a taste of how to build a model, you can decide what you
want to dig into next.

If you would like to learn more about how to use deep learning models in practice,
including how to identify and fix errors, create a real working web application, and
avoid your model causing unexpected harm to your organization or society more
generally, then keep reading the next two chapters. If you would like to start learning
the foundations of how deep learning works under the hood, skip to Chapter 4. (Did
you ever read <i>Choose</i> <i>Your</i> <i>Own</i> <i>Adventure</i> books as a kid? Well, this is kind of like
that…except with more deep learning than that book series contained.)
You will need to read all these chapters to progress further in the book, but the order
in which you read them is totally up to you. They don’t depend on each other. If you
skip ahead to Chapter 4, we will remind you at the end to come back and read the
chapters you skipped over before you go any further.

After reading pages and pages of prose, it can be hard to know which key things you
really need to focus on and remember. So, we’ve prepared a list of questions and sug‐
gested steps to complete at the end of each chapter. All the answers are in the text of
the chapter, so if you’re not sure about anything here, reread that part of the text and
make sure you understand it. Answers to all these questions are also available on the
book’s website. You can also visit the forums if you get stuck to get help from other
folks studying this material.
