<i>Figure</i> <i>1-2.</i> <i>Initial</i> <i>view</i> <i>of</i> <i>Jupyter</i> <i>Notebook</i>
You are now ready to run your first Jupyter notebook!
<b>Jargon:JupyterNotebook</b>
A piece of software that allows you to include formatted text, code,
images, videos, and much more, all within a single interactive
document. Jupyter received the highest honor for software, the
ACM Software System Award, thanks to its wide use and enormous
impact in many academic fields and in industry. Jupyter Notebook
is the software most widely used by data scientists for developing
and interacting with deep learning models.

The notebooks are numbered by chapter in the same order as they are presented in
this book. So, the very first notebook you will see listed is the notebook that you need
to use now. You will be using this notebook to train a model that can recognize dog
and cat photos. To do this, you’ll be downloading a dataset of dog and cat photos, and
using that to <i>train</i> <i>a</i> <i>model.</i>
A <i>dataset</i> is simply a bunch of data—it could be images, emails, financial indicators,
sounds, or anything else. There are many datasets made freely available that are suit‐
able for training models. Many of these datasets are created by academics to help
advance research, many are made available for competitions (there are competitions
where data scientists can compete to see who has the most accurate model!), and
some are byproducts of other processes (such as financial filings).
