Each chapter also has a “Further Research” section that poses some questions that
aren’t fully answered in the text, or gives more advanced assignments. Answers to
these questions aren’t on the book’s website; you’ll need to do your own research!
1. Why is a GPU useful for deep learning? How is a CPU different, and why is it less
effective for deep learning?
2. Try to think of three areas where feedback loops might impact the use of machine
learning. See if you can find documented examples of that happening in practice.
