We don’t have time to do a deep dive into all these libraries in this book, so we’ll just
be touching on some of the main parts of each. For a far more in-depth discussion,
we strongly suggest Wes McKinney’s <i>Python</i> <i>for</i> <i>Data</i> <i>Analysis</i> (O’Reilly). McKinney
is the creator of Pandas, so you can be sure that the information is accurate!
First, let’s gather the data we will use.
<header><largefont><b>The</b></largefont> <largefont><b>Dataset</b></largefont></header>
The dataset we use in this chapter is from the Blue Book for Bulldozers Kaggle com‐
petition, which has the following description: “The goal of the contest is to predict
the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on its usage,
equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings
and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.”
This is a very common type of dataset and prediction problem, similar to what you
may see in your project or workplace. The dataset is available for download on Kag‐
gle, a website that hosts data science competitions.

Kaggle is an awesome resource for aspiring data scientists or anyone looking to
improve their machine learning skills. There is nothing like getting hands-on practice
and receiving real-time feedback to help you improve your skills.
Kaggle provides the following:
• Interesting datasets
• Feedback on how you’re doing
• A leaderboard to see what’s good, what’s possible, and what’s state-of-the-art
• Blog posts by winning contestants sharing useful tips and techniques
Until now, all our datasets have been available to download through fastai’s integrated
dataset system. However, the dataset we will be using in this chapter is available only
from Kaggle. Therefore, you will need to register on the site, then go to the page for
the competition. On that page click Rules, and then I Understand and Accept.
(Although the competition has finished, and you will not be entering it, you still have
to agree to the rules to be allowed to download the data.)
The easiest way to download Kaggle datasets is to use the Kaggle API. You can install
this by using pip and running this in a notebook cell:
!pip install kaggle
