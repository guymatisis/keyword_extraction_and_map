If you are philosophically minded, it is somewhat dizzying to con‐
template the different kinds of hypotheticality that we are juggling
to make this calculation. First, there’s the fact that <i>every</i> prediction
is hypothetical, because we are not noting empirical data. Second,
there’s the point that we’re <i>not</i> merely interested in asking how sale
YearMade
price would change if we changed and everything else
along with it. Rather, we’re very specifically asking how sale price
would change in a hypothetical world where only YearMade
changed. Phew! It is impressive that we can ask such questions. I
recommend Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie’s recent book on cau‐
sality, <i>The</i> <i>Book</i> <i>of</i> <i>Why</i> (Basic Books), if you’re interested in more
deeply exploring formalisms for analyzing these subtleties.
With these averages, we can then plot each year on the x-axis, and each prediction on
the y-axis. This, finally, is a partial dependence plot. Let’s take a look:
<b>from</b> <b>sklearn.inspection</b> <b>import</b> plot_partial_dependence
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 4))
plot_partial_dependence(m, valid_xs_final, ['YearMade','ProductSize'],
grid_resolution=20, ax=ax);
Looking first of all at the YearMade plot, and specifically at the section covering the
years after 1990 (since, as we noted, this is where we have the most data), we can see a
nearly linear relationship between year and price. Remember that our dependent
variable is after taking the logarithm, so this means that in practice there is an expo‐
nential increase in price. This is what we would expect: depreciation is generally rec‐
ognized as being a multiplicative factor over time, so for a given sale date, varying the
year made ought to show an exponential relationship with sale price.
The ProductSize partial plot is a bit concerning. It shows that the final group, which
we saw is for missing values, has the lowest price. To use this insight in practice, we
