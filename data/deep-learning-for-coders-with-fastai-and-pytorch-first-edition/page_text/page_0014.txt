To do nearly everything in this book, you’ll need access to a computer with an
NVIDIA GPU (unfortunately, other brands of GPU are not fully supported by the
main deep learning libraries). However, we don’t recommend you buy one; in fact,
even if you already have one, we don’t suggest you use it just yet! Setting up a com‐
puter takes time and energy, and you want all your energy to focus on deep learning
right now. Therefore, we instead suggest you rent access to a computer that already
has everything you need preinstalled and ready to go. Costs can be as little as $0.25
per hour while you’re using it, and some options are even free.
<b>Jargon:GraphicsProcessingUnit(GPU)</b>
Also known as a <i>graphics</i> <i>card.</i> A special kind of processor in your
computer that can handle thousands of single tasks at the same
time, especially designed for displaying 3D environments on a
computer for playing games. These same basic tasks are very simi‐
lar to what neural networks do, such that GPUs can run neural net‐
works hundreds of times faster than regular CPUs. All modern
computers contain a GPU, but few contain the right kind of GPU
necessary for deep learning.
The best choice of GPU servers to use with this book will change over time, as com‐
panies come and go and prices change. We maintain a list of our recommended
options on the book’s website, so go there now and follow the instructions to get con‐
nected to a GPU deep learning server. Don’t worry; it takes only about two minutes to
get set up on most platforms, and many don’t even require any payment or even a
credit card to get started.

My two cents: heed this advice! If you like computers, you will be
tempted to set up your own box. Beware! It is feasible but surpris‐
ingly involved and distracting. There is a good reason this book is
not titled <i>Everything</i> <i>You</i> <i>Ever</i> <i>Wanted</i> <i>to</i> <i>Know</i> <i>About</i> <i>Ubuntu</i> <i>Sys‐</i>
<i>tem</i> <i>Administration,</i> <i>NVIDIA</i> <i>Driver</i> <i>Installation,</i> <i>apt-get,</i> <i>conda,</i> <i>pip,</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Jupyter</i> <i>Notebook</i> <i>Configuration.</i> That would be a book of its
own. Having designed and deployed our production machine
learning infrastructure at work, I can testify it has its satisfactions,
but it is as unrelated to modeling as maintaining an airplane is to
flying one.
Each option shown on the website includes a tutorial; after completing the tutorial,
you will end up with a screen looking like Figure 1-2.
