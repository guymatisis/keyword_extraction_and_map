Let’s consider how we find the right questions to ask. Of course, we wouldn’t want to
have to create all these questions ourselves—that’s what computers are for! The basic
steps to train a decision tree can be written down very easily:
1. Loop through each column of the dataset in turn.
2. For each column, loop through each possible level of that column in turn.
3. Try splitting the data into two groups, based on whether they are greater than or
less than that value (or if it is a categorical variable, based on whether they are
equal to or not equal to that level of that categorical variable).
4. Find the average sale price for each of those two groups, and see how close that is
to the actual sale price of each of the items of equipment in that group. Treat this
as a very simple “model” in which our predictions are simply the average sale
price of the item’s group.
5. After looping through all of the columns and all the possible levels for each, pick
the split point that gave the best predictions using that simple model.
6. We now have two groups for our data, based on this selected split. Treat each
group as a separate dataset, and find the best split for each by going back to step 1
for each group.
7. Continue this process recursively, until you have reached some stopping criterion
for each group—for instance, stop splitting a group further when it has only 20
items in it.
