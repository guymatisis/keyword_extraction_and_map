Services that can be used for creating datasets come and go all the
time, and their features, interfaces, and pricing change regularly
too. In this section, we’ll show how to use the Bing Image Search
API available as part of Azure Cognitive Services at the time this
book was written.
To download images with Bing Image Search, sign up at Microsoft for a free account.
You will be given a key, which you can copy and enter in a cell as follows (replacing
<i>XXX</i> with your key and executing it):
key = 'XXX'
Or, if you’re comfortable at the command line, you can set it in your terminal with
export AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=your_key_here
and then restart the Jupyter server, type this in a cell, and execute it:
key = os.environ['AZURE_SEARCH_KEY']
Once you’ve set key, you can use search_images_bing. This function is provided by
the small utils class included with the notebooks online (if you’re not sure where a
function is defined, you can just type it in your notebook to find out, as shown here):
search_images_bing
<function utils.search_images_bing(key, term, min_sz=128)>
Let’s try this function out:
results = search_images_bing(key, 'grizzly bear')
ims = results.attrgot('content_url')
len(ims)
150
We’ve successfully downloaded the URLs of 150 grizzly bears (or, at least, images that
Bing Image Search finds for that search term). Let’s look at one:
dest = 'images/grizzly.jpg'
download_url(ims[0], dest)
im = Image.open(dest)
im.to_thumb(128,128)
