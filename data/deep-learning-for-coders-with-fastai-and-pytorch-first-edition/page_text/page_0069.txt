of searches for (say) “healthy skin.” Figure 2-3 shows you kind of the results you
would get.
<i>Figure</i> <i>2-3.</i> <i>Data</i> <i>for</i> <i>a</i> <i>healthy</i> <i>skin</i> <i>detector?</i>
With this as your training data, you would end up not with a healthy skin detector,
but a <i>young</i> <i>white</i> <i>woman</i> <i>touching</i> <i>her</i> <i>face</i> detector! Be sure to think carefully about
the types of data that you might expect to see in practice in your application, and
check carefully to ensure that all these types are reflected in your model’s source data.
(Thanks to Deb Raji, who came up with the healthy skin example. See her paper
“Actionable Auditing: Investigating the Impact of Publicly Naming Biased Perfor‐
mance Results of Commercial AI Products” for more fascinating insights into model
bias.)
Now that we have downloaded some data, we need to assemble it in a format suitable
for model training. In fastai, that means creating an object called DataLoaders.
