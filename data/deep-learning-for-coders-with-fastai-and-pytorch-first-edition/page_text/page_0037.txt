environmental sound detection model using a dataset of 8,732 urban sounds. fastai’s
show_batch clearly shows how each sound has a quite distinctive spectrogram, as you
can see in Figure 1-14.

A time series can easily be converted into an image by simply plotting the time series
on a graph. However, it is often a good idea to try to represent your data in a way that
makes it as easy as possible to pull out the most important components. In a time ser‐
ies, things like seasonality and anomalies are most likely to be of interest.
Various transformations are available for time series data. For instance, fast.ai student
Ignacio Oguiza created images from a time series dataset for olive oil classification,
using a technique called Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF); you can see the
result in Figure 1-15. He then fed those images to an image classification model just
like the one you see in this chapter. His results, despite having only 30 training set
images, were well over 90% accurate, and close to the state of the art.
