• The loss depends not only on the predictions, but also on the correct <i>labels</i> (also
known as <i>targets</i> or the <i>dependent</i> <i>variable);</i> e.g., “dog” or “cat.”
After making these changes, our diagram in Figure 1-6 looks like Figure 1-8.

From this picture, we can now see some fundamental things about training a deep
learning model:
• A model cannot be created without data.
• A model can learn to operate on only the patterns seen in the input data used to
train it.
• This learning approach creates only <i>predictions,</i> not recommended <i>actions.</i>
• It’s not enough to just have examples of input data; we need <i>labels</i> for that data
too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren’t enough to train a model; we need a label
for each one, saying which ones are dogs and which are cats).
Generally speaking, we’ve seen that most organizations that say they don’t have
enough data actually mean they don’t have enough <i>labeled</i> data. If any organization is
interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have
some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they’ve been
doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic pro‐
gram), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will
almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check
how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have struc‐
tured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists gener‐
ally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We’ll be discussing
labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it’s such an important issue in practice.
Since these kinds of machine learning models can only make <i>predictions</i> (i.e., attempt
to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals
and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you’ll learn how to create a
