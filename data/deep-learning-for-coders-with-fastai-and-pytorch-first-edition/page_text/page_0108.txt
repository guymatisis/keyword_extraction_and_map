Yes, that is showing what you think it is: Google Photos classified a Black user’s photo
with their friend as “gorillas”! This algorithmic misstep got a lot of attention in the
media. “We’re appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened,” a company spokes‐
woman said. “There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labeling,
and we’re looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in
the future.”
Unfortunately, fixing problems in machine learning systems when the input data has
problems is hard. Google’s first attempt didn’t inspire confidence, as coverage by <i>The</i>
<i>Guardian</i> suggested (Figure 3-9).

These kinds of problems are certainly not limited to Google. MIT researchers studied
the most popular online computer vision APIs to see how accurate they were. But
they didn’t just calculate a single accuracy number—instead, they looked at the accu‐
racy across four groups, as illustrated in Figure 3-10.
