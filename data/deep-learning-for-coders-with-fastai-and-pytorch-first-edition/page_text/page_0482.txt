the first library to provide all of this functionality. It modifies the training loop so it
looks like Figure 16-4.

The effectiveness of this approach has been borne out over the last couple of years—
by using the fastai callback system, we were able to implement every single new paper
we tried and fulfill every user request for modifying the training loop. The training
loop itself has not required modifications. Figure 16-5 shows just a few of the call‐
backs that have been added.
