Having seen what it looks like to train a variety of models in Chapter 2, let’s now look
under the hood and see exactly what is going on. We’ll start by using computer vision
to introduce fundamental tools and concepts for deep learning.
To be exact, we’ll discuss the roles of arrays and tensors and of broadcasting, a power‐
ful technique for using them expressively. We’ll explain stochastic gradient descent
(SGD), the mechanism for learning by updating weights automatically. We’ll discuss
the choice of a loss function for our basic classification task, and the role of mini-
batches. We’ll also describe the math that a basic neural network is doing. Finally,
we’ll put all these pieces together.
In future chapters, we’ll do deep dives into other applications as well, and see how
these concepts and tools generalize. But this chapter is about laying foundation
stones. To be frank, that also makes this one of the hardest chapters, because of how
these concepts all depend on each other. Like an arch, all the stones need to be in
place for the structure to stay up. Also like an arch, once that happens, it’s a powerful
structure that can support other things. But it requires some patience to assemble.
Let’s begin. The first step is to consider how images are represented in a computer.

To understand what happens in a computer vision model, we first have to understand
how computers handle images. We’ll use one of the most famous datasets in com‐
puter vision, MNIST, for our experiments. MNIST contains images of handwritten
digits, collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and collated
into a machine learning dataset by Yann Lecun and his colleagues. Lecun used
MNIST in 1998 in LeNet-5, the first computer system to demonstrate practically use‐
