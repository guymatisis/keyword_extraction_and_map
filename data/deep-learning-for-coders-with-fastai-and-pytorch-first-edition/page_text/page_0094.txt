At university, philosophy of ethics was my main thing (it would
have been the topic of my thesis, if I’d finished it, instead of drop‐
ping out to join the real world). Based on the years I spent studying
ethics, I can tell you this: no one really agrees on what right and
wrong are, whether they exist, how to spot them, which people are
good and which bad, or pretty much anything else. So don’t expect
too much from the theory! We’re going to focus on examples and
thought starters here, not theory.
In answering the question “What Is Ethics?” the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics
says that the term refers to the following:
• Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans should
do
• The study and development of one’s ethical standards
There is no list of right answers. There is no list of dos and don’ts. Ethics is compli‐
cated and context-dependent. It involves the perspectives of many stakeholders. Eth‐
ics is a muscle that you have to develop and practice. In this chapter, our goal is to
provide some signposts to help you on that journey.
Spotting ethical issues is best to do as part of a collaborative team. This is the only
way you can really incorporate different perspectives. Different people’s backgrounds
will help them to see things that may not be obvious to you. Working with a team is
helpful for many “muscle-building” activities, including this one.
This chapter is certainly not the only part of the book where we talk about data ethics,
but it’s good to have a place where we focus on it for a while. To get oriented, it’s per‐
haps easiest to look at a few examples. So, we picked out three that we think illustrate
effectively some of the key topics.

We are going to start with three specific examples that illustrate three common ethi‐
cal issues in tech (we’ll study these issues in more depth later in the chapter):
<i>Recourse</i> <i>processes</i>
Arkansas’s buggy healthcare algorithms left patients stranded.
<i>Feedback</i> <i>loops</i>
YouTube’s recommendation system helped unleash a conspiracy theory boom.
