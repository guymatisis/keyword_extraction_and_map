<header><largefont><b>TfmdLists</b></largefont></header>
Here is the short way of doing the transformation we saw in the previous section:
tls = TfmdLists(files, [Tokenizer.from_folder(path), Numericalize])
At initialization, the TfmdLists will automatically call the setup method of each
Transform in order, providing each not with the raw items but the items transformed
by all the previous Transforms, in order. We can get the result of our Pipeline on any
raw element just by indexing into the TfmdLists:
t = tls[0]; t[:20]
tensor([ 2, 8, 91, 11, 22, 5793, 22, 37, 4910, 34,
> 11, 8, 13042, 23, 107, 30, 11, 25, 44, 14])
And the TfmdLists knows how to decode for show purposes:
tls.decode(t)[:100]
'xxbos xxmaj well , " cube " ( 1997 ) , xxmaj vincenzo \'s first movie , was one
> of the most interesti'
In fact, it even has a show method:
tls.show(t)
xxbos xxmaj well , " cube " ( 1997 ) , xxmaj vincenzo 's first movie , was one
> of the most interesting and tricky ideas that xxmaj i 've ever seen when
> talking about movies . xxmaj they had just one scenery , a bunch of actors
> and a plot . xxmaj so , what made it so special were all the effective
> direction , great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal
> like rats in a labyrinth . xxmaj his second movie , " cypher " ( 2002 ) , was
> all about its story , but it was n't so good as " cube " but here are the
> characters being tested like rats again .
" nothing " is something very interesting and gets xxmaj vincenzo coming back
> to his ' cube days ' , locking the characters once again in a very different
> space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with
> rats in an experience room . xxmaj but instead of a thriller sci - fi ( even
> some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that ) , "
> nothing " is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern
> satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we 're living .
> xxmaj once again xxmaj xxunk amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind
> of thing . 2 actors and a blinding white scenario , that 's all you got most
> part of time and you do n't need more than that . xxmaj while " cube " is a
> claustrophobic experience and " cypher " confusing , " nothing " is
> completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate .
xxmaj this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just
> a millionaire budget . xxmaj of course that the movie fails sometimes , but
> its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws . xxmaj there 's nothing
> more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise
> and a totally different experience that i had in movies since " cube " .
