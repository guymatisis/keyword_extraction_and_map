Just as with image classification, show_batch shows the dependent variable (senti‐
ment, in this case) with each independent variable (movie review text):

Looking at the DataBlock definition, every piece is familiar from previous data blocks
we’ve built, with two important exceptions:
• TextBlock.from_folder no longer has the is_lm=True parameter.
• We pass the vocab we created for the language model fine-tuning.
The reason that we pass the vocab of the language model is to make sure we use the
same correspondence of token to index. Otherwise, the embeddings we learned in
our fine-tuned language model won’t make any sense to this model, and the fine-
tuning step won’t be of any use.
By passing is_lm=False (or not passing is_lm at all, since it defaults to False), we
tell TextBlock that we have regular labeled data, rather than using the next tokens as
labels. There is one challenge we have to deal with, however, which has to do with
collating multiple documents into a mini-batch. Let’s see with an example, by trying
