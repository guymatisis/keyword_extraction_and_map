<i>Figure</i> <i>3-5.</i> <i>Coverage</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Mueller</i> <i>report</i>
Russia Today’s coverage of the Mueller report was an extreme outlier in terms of how
many channels were recommending it. This suggests the possibility that Russia
Today, a state-owned Russia media outlet, has been successful in gaming YouTube’s
recommendation algorithm. Unfortunately, the lack of transparency of systems like
this makes it hard to uncover the kinds of problems that we’re discussing.
One of our reviewers for this book, Aurélien Géron, led YouTube’s video classification
team from 2013 to 2016 (well before the events discussed here). He pointed out that
it’s not just feedback loops involving humans that are a problem. There can also be
feedback loops without humans! He told us about an example from YouTube:
One important signal to classify the main topic of a video is the channel it comes from.
For example, a video uploaded to a cooking channel is very likely to be a cooking
video. But how do we know what topic a channel is about? Well…in part by looking at
the topics of the videos it contains! Do you see the loop? For example, many videos
have a description which indicates what camera was used to shoot the video. As a
result, some of these videos might get classified as videos about “photography.” If a
channel has such a misclassified video, it might be classified as a “photography” chan‐
nel, making it even more likely for future videos on this channel to be wrongly classi‐
fied as “photography.” This could even lead to runaway virus-like classifications! One
way to break this feedback loop is to classify videos with and without the channel sig‐
nal. Then when classifying the channels, you can only use the classes obtained without
the channel signal. This way, the feedback loop is broken.
