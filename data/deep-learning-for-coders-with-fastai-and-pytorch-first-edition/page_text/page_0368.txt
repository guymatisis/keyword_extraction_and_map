<header><largefont><b>Conclusion</b></largefont></header>
fastai provides a layered API. It takes one line of code to grab the data when it’s in one
of the usual settings, making it easy for beginners to focus on training a model
without spending too much time assembling the data. Then, the high-level data block
API gives you more flexibility by allowing you to mix and match building blocks.
Underneath it, the mid-level API gives you greater flexibility to apply transformations
on your items. In your real-world problems, this is probably what you will need to
use, and we hope it makes the step of data-munging as easy as possible.

1. Why do we say that fastai has a “layered” API? What does it mean?
2. Why does a Transform have a decode method? What does it do?
3. Why does a Transform have a setup method? What does it do?
4. How does a Transform work when called on a tuple?
5. Which methods do you need to implement when writing your own Transform?
6. Write a Normalize transform that fully normalizes items (subtract the mean and
divide by the standard deviation of the dataset), and that can decode that behav‐
ior. Try not to peek!
Transform
7. Write a that does the numericalization of tokenized texts (it should set
its vocab automatically from the dataset seen and have a decode method). Look
at the source code of fastai if you need help.
8. What is a Pipeline?
TfmdLists?
9. What is a
10. What is a Datasets? How is it different from a TfmdLists?
11. Why are TfmdLists and Datasets named with an “s”?
12. How can you build a DataLoaders from a TfmdLists or a Datasets ?
item_tfms batch_tfms DataLoaders
13. How do you pass and when building a from
a TfmdLists or a Datasets?
14. What do you need to do when you want to have your custom items work with
methods like show_batch or show_results?

15. Why can we easily apply fastai data augmentation transforms to the
we built?
