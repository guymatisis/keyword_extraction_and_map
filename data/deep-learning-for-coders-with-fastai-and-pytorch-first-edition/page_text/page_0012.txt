Let’s now focus on what you will learn, starting with the software.

We’ve completed hundreds of machine learning projects using dozens of packages,
and many programming languages. At fast.ai, we have written courses using most of
the main deep learning and machine learning packages used today. After PyTorch
came out in 2017, we spent over a thousand hours testing it before deciding that we
would use it for future courses, software development, and research. Since that time,
PyTorch has become the world’s fastest-growing deep learning library and is already
used for most research papers at top conferences. This is generally a leading indicator
of usage in industry, because these are the papers that end up getting used in products
and services commercially. We have found that PyTorch is the most flexible and
expressive library for deep learning. It does not trade off speed for simplicity, but pro‐
vides both.
PyTorch works best as a low-level foundation library, providing the basic operations
for higher-level functionality. The fastai library is the most popular library for adding
this higher-level functionality on top of PyTorch. It’s also particularly well suited to
the purposes of this book, because it is unique in providing a deeply layered software
architecture (there’s even a peer-reviewed academic paper about this layered API). In
this book, as we go deeper and deeper into the foundations of deep learning, we will
also go deeper and deeper into the layers of fastai. This book covers version 2 of the
fastai library, which is a from-scratch rewrite providing many unique features.
However, it doesn’t really matter what software you learn, because it takes only a few
days to learn to switch from one library to another. What really matters is learning
the deep learning foundations and techniques properly. Our focus will be on using
code that, as clearly as possible, expresses the concepts that you need to learn. Where
we are teaching high-level concepts, we will use high-level fastai code. Where we are
teaching low-level concepts, we will use low-level PyTorch or even pure Python code.
Though it may seem like new deep learning libraries are appearing at a rapid pace
nowadays, you need to be prepared for a much faster rate of change in the coming
months and years. As more people enter the field, they will bring more skills and
ideas, and try more things. You should assume that whatever specific libraries and
software you learn today will be obsolete in a year or two. Just think about the num‐
ber of changes in libraries and technology stacks that occur all the time in the world
of web programming—a much more mature and slow-growing area than deep
learning. We strongly believe that the focus in learning needs to be on understanding
the underlying techniques and how to apply them in practice, and how to quickly
build expertise in new tools and techniques as they are released.
