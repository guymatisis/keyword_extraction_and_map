when he was an undergraduate. Even at Tesla, where they’re trying to solve the
extremely tough challenge of making a self-driving car, CEO Elon Musk says:
A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI & abil‐
ity to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard).
Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
What you will need to do to succeed, however, is to apply what you learn in this book
to a personal project, and always persevere.

Whether you’re excited to identify if plants are diseased from pictures of their leaves,
autogenerate knitting patterns, diagnose TB from X-rays, or determine when a rac‐
coon is using your cat door, we will get you using deep learning on your own prob‐
lems (via pretrained models from others) as quickly as possible, and then will
progressively drill into more details. You’ll learn how to use deep learning to solve
your own problems at state-of-the-art accuracy within the first 30 minutes of the next
chapter! (And feel free to skip straight there now if you’re dying to get coding right
away.) There is a pernicious myth out there that you need to have computing resour‐
ces and datasets the size of those at Google to be able to do deep learning, but it’s not
true.
So, what sorts of tasks make for good test cases? You could train your model to distin‐
guish between Picasso and Monet paintings or to pick out pictures of your daughter
instead of pictures of your son. It helps to focus on your hobbies and passions—set‐
ting yourself four or five little projects rather than striving to solve a big, grand prob‐
lem tends to work better when you’re getting started. Since it is easy to get stuck,
trying to be too ambitious too early can often backfire. Then, once you’ve got the
basics mastered, aim to complete something you’re really proud of!

Deep learning can be set to work on almost any problem. For
instance, my first startup was a company called FastMail, which
provided enhanced email services when it launched in 1999 (and
still does to this day). In 2002, I set it up to use a primitive form of
deep learning, single-layer neural networks, to help categorize
emails and stop customers from receiving spam.
Common character traits in the people who do well at deep learning include playful‐
ness and curiosity. The late physicist Richard Feynman is an example of someone we’d
expect to be great at deep learning: his development of an understanding of the
movement of subatomic particles came from his amusement at how plates wobble
when they spin in the air.
