Let’s create a first SiameseImage and check that our show method works:
img = PILImage.create(files[0])
s = SiameseImage(img, img, True)
s.show();
We can also try with a second image that’s not from the same class:
img1 = PILImage.create(files[1])
s1 = SiameseImage(img, img1, False)
s1.show();
The important thing with transforms that we saw before is that they dispatch over
tuples or their subclasses. That’s precisely why we chose to subclass Tuple in this
instance—this way, we can apply any transform that works on images to our Siamese
Image, and it will be applied on each image in the tuple:
s2 = Resize(224)(s1)
s2.show();
Here the Resize transform is applied to each of the two images, but not the Boolean
flag. Even if we have a custom type, we can thus benefit from all the data augmenta‐
tion transforms inside the library.
