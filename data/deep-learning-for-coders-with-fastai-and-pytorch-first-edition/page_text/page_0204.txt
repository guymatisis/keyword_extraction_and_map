Oh, dear—in this case, a confusion matrix is very hard to read. We have 37 pet
breeds, which means we have 37×37 entries in this giant matrix! Instead, we can use
most_confused
the method, which just shows us the cells of the confusion matrix
with the most incorrect predictions (here, with at least 5 or more):
interp.most_confused(min_val=5)
[('american_pit_bull_terrier', 'staffordshire_bull_terrier', 10),
('Ragdoll', 'Birman', 6)]
Since we are not pet breed experts, it is hard for us to know whether these category
errors reflect actual difficulties in recognizing breeds. So again, we turn to Google. A
little bit of Googling tells us that the most common category errors shown here are
breed differences that even expert breeders sometimes disagree about. So this gives us
some comfort that we are on the right track.
