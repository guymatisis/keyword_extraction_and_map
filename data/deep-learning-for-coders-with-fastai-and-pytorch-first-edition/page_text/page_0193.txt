Pipeline: partial -> Categorize
starting from

applying partial gives
american_bulldog
applying Categorize gives
TensorCategory(12)
Final sample: (PILImage mode=RGB size=375x500, TensorCategory(12))

Building one batch
Applying item_tfms to the first sample:
Pipeline: ToTensor
starting from
(PILImage mode=RGB size=375x500, TensorCategory(12))
applying ToTensor gives
(TensorImage of size 3x500x375, TensorCategory(12))

Collating items in a batch
Error! It's not possible to collate your items in a batch
Could not collate the 0-th members of your tuples because got the following
shapes:
torch.Size([3, 500, 375]),torch.Size([3, 375, 500]),torch.Size([3, 333, 500]),
torch.Size([3, 375, 500])
You can see exactly how we gathered the data and split it, how we went from a file‐
name to a <i>sample</i> (the tuple (image, category)), then what item transforms were
applied and how it failed to collate those samples in a batch (because of the different
shapes).
Once you think your data looks right, we generally recommend the next step should
be using it to train a simple model. We often see people put off the training of an
actual model for far too long. As a result, they don’t find out what their baseline
results look like. Perhaps your problem doesn’t require lots of fancy domain-specific
engineering. Or perhaps the data doesn’t seem to train the model at all. These are
things that you want to know as soon as possible.
