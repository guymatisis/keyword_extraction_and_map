Jupyter notebooks can be in one of two modes: edit mode or command mode. In edit
mode, typing on your keyboard enters the letters into the cell in the usual way. How‐
ever, in command mode, you will not see any flashing cursor, and each key on your
keyboard will have a special function.
Before continuing, press the Escape key on your keyboard to switch to command
mode (if you are already in command mode, this does nothing, so press it now just in
case). To see a complete list of all the functions available, press H; press Escape to
remove this help screen. Notice that in command mode, unlike in most programs,
commands do not require you to hold down Control, Alt, or similar—you simply
press the required letter key.
You can make a copy of a cell by pressing C (the cell needs to be selected first, indica‐
ted with an outline around it; if it is not already selected, click it once). Then press V
to paste a copy of it.
Click the cell that begins with the line “# CLICK ME” to select it. The first character
in that line indicates that what follows is a comment in Python, so it is ignored when
executing the cell. The rest of the cell is, believe it or not, a complete system for creat‐
ing and training a state-of-the-art model for recognizing cats versus dogs. So, let’s
train it now! To do so, just press Shift-Enter on your keyboard, or click the Play but‐
ton on the toolbar. Then wait a few minutes while the following things happen:
1. A dataset called the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset that contains 7,349 images of cats
and dogs from 37 breeds will be downloaded from the fast.ai datasets collection
to the GPU server you are using, and will then be extracted.
2. A <i>pretrained</i> <i>model</i> that has already been trained on 1.3 million images using a
competition-winning model will be downloaded from the internet.
3. The pretrained model will be <i>fine-tuned</i> using the latest advances in transfer
learning to create a model that is specially customized for recognizing dogs and
cats.
The first two steps need to be run only once on your GPU server. If you run the cell
again, it will use the dataset and model that have already been downloaded, rather
than downloading them again. Let’s take a look at the contents of the cell and the
results (Table 1-2):
