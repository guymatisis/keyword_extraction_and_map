This final chapter (other than the conclusion and the online chapters) is going to look
a bit different. It contains far more code and far less prose than the previous chapters.
We will introduce new Python keywords and libraries without discussing them. This
chapter is meant to be the start of a significant research project for you. You see, we
are going to implement many of the key pieces of the fastai and PyTorch APIs from
scratch, building on nothing other than the components that we developed in Chap‐
Learner
ter 17! The key goal here is to end up with your own class and some call‐
backs—enough to be able to train a model on Imagenette, including examples of each
of the key techniques we’ve studied. On the way to building Learner , we will create
Module, Parameter DataLoader
our own versions of and a parallel so you’ll have a
very good idea of what those PyTorch classes do.
The end-of-chapter questionnaire is particularly important for this chapter. This is
where we will be pointing you in the many interesting directions that you could take,
using this chapter as your starting point. We suggest that you follow along with this
chapter on your computer, and do lots of experiments, web searches, and whatever
else you need to understand what’s going on. You’ve built up the skills and expertise
to do this in the rest of this book, so we think you are going to do great!
Let’s begin by gathering (manually) some data.

Have a look at the source to untar_data to see how it works. We’ll use it here to
access the 160-pixel version of Imagenette for use in this chapter:
path = untar_data(URLs.IMAGENETTE_160)
