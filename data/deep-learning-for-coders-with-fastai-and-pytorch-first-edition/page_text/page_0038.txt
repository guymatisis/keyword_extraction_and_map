Another interesting fast.ai student project example comes from Gleb Esman. He was
working on fraud detection at Splunk, using a dataset of users’ mouse movements
and mouse clicks. He turned these into pictures by drawing an image displaying the
position, speed, and acceleration of the mouse pointer by using colored lines, and the
clicks were displayed using small colored circles, as shown in Figure 1-16. He fed this
into an image recognition model just like the one we’ve used in this chapter, and it
worked so well that it led to a patent for this approach to fraud analytics!
