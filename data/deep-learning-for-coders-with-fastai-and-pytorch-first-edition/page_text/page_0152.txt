The sequence of steps we described earlier starts by picking a random value for a
parameter, and calculating the value of the loss:
plot_function(f, 'x', 'x**2')
plt.scatter(-1.5, f(-1.5), color='red');
Now we look to see what would happen if we increased or decreased our parameter
by a little bitâ€”the <i>adjustment.</i> This is simply the slope at a particular point:
