These questions may be able to help you identify outstanding issues, and possible
alternatives that are easier to understand and control. In addition to asking the right
questions, it’s also important to consider practices and processes to implement.
One thing to consider at this stage is what data you are collecting and storing. Data
often ends up being used for different purposes the original intent. For instance, IBM
began selling to Nazi Germany well before the Holocaust, including helping with
Germany’s 1933 census conducted by Adolf Hitler, which was effective at identifying
far more Jewish people than had previously been recognized in Germany. Similarly,
US census data was used to round up Japanese-Americans (who were US citizens) for
internment during World War II. It is important to recognize how data and images
collected can be weaponized later. Columbia professor Tim Wu wrote “You must
assume that any personal data that Facebook or Android keeps are data that govern‐
ments around the world will try to get or that thieves will try to steal.”

The Markkula Center has released An Ethical Toolkit for Engineering/Design Prac‐
tice that includes concrete practices to implement at your company, including regu‐
larly scheduled sweeps to proactively search for ethical risks (in a manner similar to
cybersecurity penetration testing), expanding the ethical circle to include the perspec‐
tives of a variety of stakeholders, and considering the terrible people (how could bad
actors abuse, steal, misinterpret, hack, destroy, or weaponize what you are building?).
Even if you don’t have a diverse team, you can still try to proactively include the per‐
spectives of a wider group, considering questions such as these (provided by the
Markkula Center):
• Whose interests, desires, skills, experiences, and values have we simply assumed,
rather than actually consulted?
• Who are all the stakeholders who will be directly affected by our product? How
have their interests been protected? How do we know what their inter‐
ests really are—have we asked?
• Who/which groups and individuals will be indirectly affected in significant ways?
• Who might use this product that we didn’t expect to use it, or for purposes we
didn’t initially intend?

Another useful resource from the Markkula Center is its Conceptual Frameworks in
Technology and Engineering Practice. This considers how different foundational eth‐
ical lenses can help identify concrete issues, and lays out the following approaches
and key questions:
