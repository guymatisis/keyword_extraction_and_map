In our very first model, we learned how to classify dogs versus cats. Just a few years
ago, this was considered a very challenging task—but today, it’s far too easy! We will
not be able to show you the nuances of training models with this problem, because
we get a nearly perfect result without worrying about any of the details. But it turns
out that the same dataset also allows us to work on a much more challenging prob‐
lem: figuring out what breed of pet is shown in each image.
In Chapter 1, we presented the applications as already-solved problems. But this is
not how things work in real life. We start with a dataset that we know nothing about.
We then have to figure out how it is put together, how to extract the data we need
from it, and what that data looks like. For the rest of this book, we will be showing
you how to solve these problems in practice, including all of the intermediate steps
necessary to understand the data that we are working with and test your modeling as
you go.
We already downloaded the Pets dataset, and we can get a path to this dataset using
the same code as in Chapter 1:
<b>from</b> <b>fastai2.vision.all</b> <b>import</b> *
path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)
Now if we are going to understand how to extract the breed of each pet from each
image, we’re going to need to understand how this data is laid out. Such details of
data layout are a vital piece of the deep learning puzzle. Data is usually provided in
one of these two ways:
• Individual files representing items of data, such as text documents or images,
possibly organized into folders or with filenames representing information about
those items
• A table of data (e.g., in CSV format) in which each row is an item and may
include filenames providing connections between the data in the table and data
in other formats, such as text documents and images
There are exceptions to these rules—particularly in domains such as genomics, where
there can be binary database formats or even network streams—but overall the vast
majority of the datasets you’ll work with will use some combination of these two
formats.
To see what is in our dataset, we can use the ls method:
path.ls()
(#3) [Path('annotations'),Path('images'),Path('models')]
