Markkula’s recommendations include a deeper dive into each of these perspectives,
including looking at a project through the lens of its <i>consequences:</i>
• Who will be directly affected by this project? Who will be indirectly affected?
• Will the effects in aggregate likely create more good than harm, and what types of
good and harm?
• Are we thinking about all relevant types of harm/benefit (psychological, political,
environmental, moral, cognitive, emotional, institutional, cultural)?
• How might future generations be affected by this project?
• Do the risks of harm from this project fall disproportionately on the least power‐
ful in society? Will the benefits go disproportionately to the well-off?
• Have we adequately considered “dual-use” and unintended downstream effects?
The alternative lens to this is the <i>deontological</i> perspective, which focuses on basic
concepts of <i>right</i> and <i>wrong:</i>
• What rights of others and duties to others must we respect?
• How might the dignity and autonomy of each stakeholder be impacted by this
project?
• What considerations of trust and of justice are relevant to this design/project?
• Does this project involve any conflicting moral duties to others, or conflicting
stakeholder rights? How can we prioritize these?
One of the best ways to help come up with complete and thoughtful answers to ques‐
tions like these is to ensure that the people asking the questions are <i>diverse.</i>
