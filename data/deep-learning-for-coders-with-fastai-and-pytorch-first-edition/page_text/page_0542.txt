Finally, we’ll check that the learning rate followed the schedule we defined (as you see,
we’re not using cosine annealing here):
plt.plot(onecyc.lrs);

We have explored how the key concepts of the fastai library are implemented by re-
implementing them in this chapter. Since it’s mostly full of code, you should definitely
try to experiment with it by looking at the corresponding notebook on the book’s
website. Now that you know how it’s built, as a next step be sure to check out the
intermediate and advanced tutorials in the fastai documentation to learn how to cus‐
tomize every bit of the library.

<b>Experiments</b>
For the questions here that ask you to explain what a function or
class is, you should also complete your own code experiments.
1. What is glob?
2. How do you open an image with the Python imaging library?
3. What does L.map do?
4. What does Self do?
5. What is L.val2idx?
6. What methods do you need to implement to create your own Dataset?
7. Why do we call convert when we open an image from Imagenette?
