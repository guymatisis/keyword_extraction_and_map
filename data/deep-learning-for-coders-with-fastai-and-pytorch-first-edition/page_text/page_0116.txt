• Algorithmic systems are cheap.
Even in the absence of bias, algorithms (and deep learning especially, since it is such
an effective and scalable algorithm) can lead to negative societal problems, such as
when used for <i>disinformation.</i>
<header><largefont><b>Disinformation</b></largefont></header>
<i>Disinformation</i> has a history stretching back hundreds or even thousands of years. It
is not necessarily about getting someone to believe something false, but rather often
used to sow disharmony and uncertainty, and to get people to give up on seeking the
truth. Receiving conflicting accounts can lead people to assume that they can never
know whom or what to trust.
Some people think disinformation is primarily about false information or <i>fake</i> <i>news,</i>
but in reality, disinformation can often contain seeds of truth, or half-truths taken out
of context. Ladislav Bittman was an intelligence officer in the USSR who later defec‐
ted to the US and wrote some books in the 1970s and 1980s on the role of disinfor‐
mation in Soviet propaganda operations. In <i>The</i> <i>KGB</i> <i>and</i> <i>Soviet</i> <i>Disinformation</i>
(Pergamon), he wrote “Most campaigns are a carefully designed mixture of facts,
half-truths, exaggerations, and deliberate lies.”
In the US, this has hit close to home in recent years, with the FBI detailing a massive
disinformation campaign linked to Russia in the 2016 election. Understanding the
disinformation that was used in this campaign is very educational. For instance, the
FBI found that the Russian disinformation campaign often organized two separate
fake “grass roots” protests, one for each side of an issue, and got them to protest at the
same time! The Houston Chronicle reported on one of these odd events
(Figure 3-15):
A group that called itself the “Heart of Texas” had organized it on social media—a pro‐
test, they said, against the “Islamization” of Texas. On one side of Travis Street, I found
about 10 protesters. On the other side, I found around 50 counterprotesters. But I
couldn’t find the rally organizers. No “Heart of Texas.” I thought that was odd, and
mentioned it in the article: What kind of group is a no-show at its own event? Now I
know why. Apparently, the rally’s organizers were in Saint Petersburg, Russia, at the
time. “Heart of Texas” is one of the internet troll groups cited in Special Prosecutor
Robert Mueller’s recent indictment of Russians attempting to tamper with the US pres‐
idential election.
