31. What kind of model should we use if we want to add metadata about users and
items, or information such as date and time, to a collaborative filtering model?

1. Take a look at all the differences between the Embedding version of DotProduct
Bias and the create_params version, and try to understand why each of those
changes is required. If you’re not sure, try reverting each change to see what hap‐
pens. (NB: even the type of brackets used in forward has changed!)
2. Find three other areas where collaborative filtering is being used, and identify the
pros and cons of this approach in those areas.
3. Complete this notebook using the full MovieLens dataset, and compare your
results to online benchmarks. See if you can improve your accuracy. Look on the
book’s website and the fast.ai forums for ideas. Note that there are more columns
in the full dataset—see if you can use those too (the next chapter might give you
ideas).
4. Create a model for MovieLens that works with cross-entropy loss, and compare it
to the model in this chapter.
