This picture shows the two steps:
1. <i>Crop</i> <i>full</i> <i>width</i> <i>or</i> <i>height:</i> This is in item_tfms, so it’s applied to each individual
image before it is copied to the GPU. It’s used to ensure all images are the same
size. On the training set, the crop area is chosen randomly. On the validation set,
the center square of the image is always chosen.
batch_tfms,
2. <i>Random</i> <i>crop</i> <i>and</i> <i>augment:</i> This is in so it’s applied to a batch all at
once on the GPU, which means it’s fast. On the validation set, only the resize to
the final size needed for the model is done here. On the training set, the random
crop and any other augmentations are done first.
