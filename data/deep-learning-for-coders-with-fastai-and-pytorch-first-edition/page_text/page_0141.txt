Here’s a sample 3:
a_3 = stacked_threes[1]
show_image(a_3);
How can we determine its distance from our ideal 3? We can’t just add up the differ‐
ences between the pixels of this image and the ideal digit. Some differences will be
positive, while others will be negative, and these differences will cancel out, resulting
in a situation where an image that is too dark in some places and too light in others
might be shown as having zero total differences from the ideal. That would be
misleading!
To avoid this, data scientists use two main ways to measure distance in this context:
• Take the mean of the <i>absolute</i> <i>value</i> of differences (absolute value is the function
that replaces negative values with positive values). This is called the <i>mean</i> <i>abso‐</i>
<i>lute</i> <i>difference</i> or <i>L1</i> <i>norm.</i>
• Take the mean of the <i>square</i> of differences (which makes everything positive) and
then take the <i>square</i> <i>root</i> (which undoes the squaring). This is called the <i>root</i>
<i>mean</i> <i>squared</i> <i>error</i> (RMSE) or <i>L2</i> <i>norm.</i>
<b>It’sOKtoHaveForgottenYourMath</b>
In this book, we generally assume that you have completed high
school math, and remember at least some of it—but everybody for‐
gets some things! It all depends on what you happen to have had
reason to practice in the meantime. Perhaps you have forgotten
what a <i>square</i> <i>root</i> is, or exactly how they work. No problem! Any‐
time you come across a math concept that is not explained fully in
this book, don’t just keep moving on; instead, stop and look it up.
Make sure you understand the basic idea, how it works, and why
we might be using it. One of the best places to refresh your under‐
standing is Khan Academy. For instance, Khan Academy has a
great introduction to square roots.
