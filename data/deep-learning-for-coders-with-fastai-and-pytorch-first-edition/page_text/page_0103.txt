And this phenomenon was not contained to this particular type of content. In June
2019, the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> published an article on YouTube’s recommendation system
titled “On YouTube’s Digital Playground, an Open Gate for Pedophiles”. The article
started with this chilling story:
Christiane C. didn’t think anything of it when her 10-year-old daughter and a friend
uploaded a video of themselves playing in a backyard pool…A few days later…the
video had thousands of views. Before long, it had ticked up to 400,000…“I saw the
video again and I got scared by the number of views,” Christiane said. She had reason
to be. YouTube’s automated recommendation system…had begun showing the video to
users who watched other videos of prepubescent, partially clothed children, a team of
researchers has found.
On its own, each video might be perfectly innocent, a home movie, say, made by a
child. Any revealing frames are fleeting and appear accidental. But, grouped together,
their shared features become unmistakable.
YouTube’s recommendation algorithm had begun curating playlists for pedophiles,
picking out innocent home videos that happened to contain prepubescent, partially
clothed children.
No one at Google planned to create a system that turned family videos into porn for
pedophiles. So what happened?
Part of the problem here is the centrality of metrics in driving a financially important
system. When an algorithm has a metric to optimize, as you have seen, it will do
everything it can to optimize that number. This tends to lead to all kinds of edge
cases, and humans interacting with a system will search for, find, and exploit these
edge cases and feedback loops for their advantage.
There are signs that this is exactly what has happened with YouTube’s recommenda‐
tion system in 2018. <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i> ran an article called “How an Ex-YouTube Insider
Investigated Its Secret Algorithm” about Guillaume Chaslot, an ex-YouTube engineer
who created a website that tracks these issues. Chaslot published the chart in
Figure 3-5 following the release of Robert Mueller’s “Report on the Investigation Into
Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.”
