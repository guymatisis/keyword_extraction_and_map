scandal, in which the car company was revealed to have cheated on its diesel emis‐
sions tests, was not the manager who oversaw the project, or an executive at the helm
of the company. It was one of the engineers, James Liang, who just did what he was
told.
Of course, it’s not all bad—if a project you are involved in turns out to make a huge
positive impact on even one person, this is going to make you feel pretty great!
OK, so hopefully we have convinced you that you ought to care. But what should you
do? As data scientists, we’re naturally inclined to focus on making our models better
by optimizing some metric or other. But optimizing that metric may not lead to bet‐
ter outcomes. And even if it <i>does</i> help create better outcomes, it almost certainly
won’t be the only thing that matters. Consider the pipeline of steps that occurs
between the development of a model or an algorithm by a researcher or practitioner,
and the point at which this work is used to make a decision. This entire pipeline
needs to be considered <i>as</i> <i>a</i> <i>whole</i> if we’re to have a hope of getting the kinds of out‐
comes we want.
Normally, there is a very long chain from one end to the other. This is especially true
if you are a researcher who might not even know if your research will ever get used
for anything, or if you’re involved in data collection, which is even earlier in the pipe‐
line. But no one is better placed to inform everyone involved in this chain about the
capabilities, constraints, and details of your work than you are. Although there’s no
“silver bullet” that can ensure your work is used the right way, by getting involved in
the process, and asking the right questions, you can at the very least ensure that the
right issues are being considered.
Sometimes, the right response to being asked to do a piece of work is to just say “no.”
Often, however, the response we hear is, “If I don’t do it, someone else will.” But con‐
sider this: if you’ve been picked for the job, you’re the best person they’ve found to do
it—so if you don’t do it, the best person isn’t working on that project. If the first five
people they ask all say no too, so much the better!

Presumably, the reason you’re doing this work is that you hope it will be used for
something. Otherwise, you’re just wasting your time. So, let’s start with the assump‐
tion that your work will end up somewhere. Now, as you are collecting your data and
developing your model, you are making lots of decisions. What level of aggregation
will you store your data at? What loss function should you use? What validation and
training sets should you use? Should you focus on simplicity of implementation,
speed of inference, or accuracy of the model? How will your model handle out-of-
domain data items? Can it be fine-tuned, or must it be retrained from scratch over
time?
