<b>FullandStrippedNotebooks</b>
There are two folders containing different versions of the note‐
books. The <i>full</i> folder contains the exact notebooks used to create
the book you’re reading now, with all the prose and outputs. The
<i>stripped</i> version has the same headings and code cells, but all out‐
puts and prose have been removed. After reading a section of the
book, we recommend working through the stripped notebooks,
with the book closed, and seeing if you can figure out what each
cell will show before you execute it. Also try to recall what the code
is demonstrating.
To open a notebook, just click it. The notebook will open, and it will look something
like Figure 1-3 (note that there may be slight differences in details across different
platforms; you can ignore those differences).

A notebook consists of <i>cells.</i> There are two main types of cell:
• Cells containing formatted text, images, and so forth. These use a format called
<i>Markdown,</i> which you will learn about soon.
• Cells containing code that can be executed, and outputs will appear immediately
underneath (which could be plain text, tables, images, animations, sounds, or
even interactive applications).
