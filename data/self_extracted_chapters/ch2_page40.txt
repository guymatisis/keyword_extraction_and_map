           This equation introduces several very common Machine Learning notations that we
           will use throughout this book:                             
            • m is the number of instances in the dataset you are measuring the RMSE on.
              —For example, if you are evaluating the RMSE on a validation set of 2,000 dis‐
               tricts, then m = 2,000.                                
                                                                      
            • x(i) is a vector of all the feature values (excluding the label) of the ith instance in
              the dataset, and y(i) is its label (the desired output value for that instance).
              —For example, if the first district in the dataset is located at longitude –118.29°,
               latitude 33.91°, and it has 1,416 inhabitants with a median income of $38,372,
               and the median house value is $156,400 (ignoring the other features for now),
               then:

               and:

            • X is a matrix containing all the feature values (excluding labels) of all instances in
              the dataset. There is one row per instance, and the ith row is equal to the trans‐
              pose of x(i), noted (x(i))⊺.4                           
              —For example, if the first district is as just described, then the matrix X looks
               like this:
