The K-Means algorithm                           
          Although the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not converge to the right
          solution (i.e., it may converge to a local optimum): whether it does or not depends on
          the centroid initialization. Figure 9-5 shows two suboptimal solutions that the algo‐
          rithm can converge to if you are not lucky with the random initialization step.

          Let’s look at a few ways you can mitigate this risk by improving the centroid
          initialization.
