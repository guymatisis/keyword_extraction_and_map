We can create a new training set using these pre‐
          dicted values as input features (which makes this new training set 3D), and keeping
          the target values. The blender is trained on this new training set, so it learns to pre‐
          dict the target value, given the first layer’s predictions.

          It is actually possible to train several different blenders this way (e.g., one using Lin‐
          ear Regression, another using Random Forest Regression), to get a whole layer of
          blenders. The trick is to split the training set into three subsets: the first one is used to
          train the first layer, the second one is used to create the training set used to train the
          second layer (using predictions made by the predictors of the first layer), and the
          third one is used to create the training set to train the third layer (using predictions
          made by the predictors of the second layer). Once this is done, we can make a predic‐
          tion for a new instance by going through each layer sequentially, as shown in
          Figure 7-15.
