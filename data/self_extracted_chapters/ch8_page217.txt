In
          many cases the subspace may twist and turn, such as in the famous Swiss roll toy data‚Äê
          set represented in Figure 8-4.

          Simply projecting onto a plane (e.g., by dropping x ) would squash different layers of

          the Swiss roll together, as shown on the left side of Figure 8-5. What you really want is
          to unroll the Swiss roll to obtain the 2D dataset on the right side of Figure 8-5.
