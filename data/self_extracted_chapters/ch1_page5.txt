          lem. Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover pat‐
          terns that were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.

          To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:                
                                                                      
           • Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of
            rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform bet‐
            ter than the traditional approach.                        
           • Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solu‐
            tion: the best Machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.
           • Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
           • Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

          niques that can tackle them:                                
          Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them
            This is image classification, typically performed using convolutional neural net‐
