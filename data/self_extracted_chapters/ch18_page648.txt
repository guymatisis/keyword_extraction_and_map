          The result of all this preprocessing is shown in Figure 18-12. You can see that the res‚Äê
          olution is much lower, but sufficient to play the game. Moreover, frames are stacked
          along the channels dimension, so red represents the frame from three steps ago,
          green is two steps ago, blue is the previous frame, and pink is the current frame.20
          From this single observation, the agent can see that the ball is going toward the
          lower-left corner, and that it should continue to move the paddle to the left (as it did
          in the previous steps).

          Lastly, we can wrap the environment inside a TFPyEnvironment:
            from tf_agents.environments.tf_py_environment import TFPyEnvironment
                                                                      
            tf_env = TFPyEnvironment(env)                             
          This will make the environment usable from within a TensorFlow graph (under the
          hood, this class relies on tf.py_function(), which allows a graph to call arbitrary
                                                                      
                                                                      
          20 Since there are only three primary colors, you cannot just display an image with four color channels. For this
           reason, I combined the last channel with the first three to get the RGB image represented here. Pink is actually
           a mix of blue and red, but the agent sees four independent channels.
