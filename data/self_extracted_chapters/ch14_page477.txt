                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          An SE block analyzes the output of the unit it is attached to, focusing exclusively on
          the depth dimension (it does not look for any spatial pattern), and it learns which fea‐
          tures are usually most active together. It then uses this information to recalibrate the
          feature maps, as shown in Figure 14-21. For example, an SE block may learn that
          mouths, noses, and eyes usually appear together in pictures: if you see a mouth and a
          nose, you should expect to see eyes as well. So if the block sees a strong activation in
          the mouth and nose feature maps, but only mild activation in the eye feature map, it
          will boost the eye feature map (more accurately, it will reduce irrelevant feature
          maps). If the eyes were somewhat confused with something else, this feature map
          recalibration will help resolve the ambiguity.

          An SE block is composed of just three layers: a global average pooling layer, a hidden
          dense layer using the ReLU activation function, and a dense output layer using the
          sigmoid activation function (see Figure 14-22).

          As earlier, the global average pooling layer computes the mean activation for each fea‐
          ture map: for example, if its input contains 256 feature maps, it will output 256
