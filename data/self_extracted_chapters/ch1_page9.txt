          Unsupervised learning                                       
          In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled
          (Figure 1-7). The system tries to learn without a teacher.  
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          2 Some neural network architectures can be unsupervised, such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann
           machines. They can also be semisupervised, such as in deep belief networks and unsupervised pretraining.
