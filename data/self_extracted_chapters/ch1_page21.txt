                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Now the model fits the training data as closely as possible (for a linear model), as you
          can see in Figure 1-19.

          You are finally ready to run the model to make predictions. For example, say you
          want to know how happy Cypriots are, and the OECD data does not have the answer.
          Fortunately, you can use your model to make a good prediction: you look up Cyprus’s
          GDP per capita, find $22,587, and then apply your model and find that life satisfac‐
          tion is likely to be somewhere around 4.85 + 22,587 × 4.91 × 10-5 = 5.96.
          To whet your appetite, Example 1-1 shows the Python code that loads the data, pre‐
          pares it,6 creates a scatterplot for visualization, and then trains a linear model and
          makes a prediction.7

          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                             
          import numpy as np                                          
          import pandas as pd                                         
          import sklearn.linear_model                                 
          # Load the data                                             
          oecd_bli = pd.read_csv("oecd_bli_2015.csv", thousands=',')  
          gdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv("gdp_per_capita.csv",thousands=',',delimiter='\t',
                           encoding='latin1', na_values="n/a")        
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          6 The prepare_country_stats() function’s definition is not shown here (see this chapter’s Jupyter notebook if
           you want all the gory details). It’s just boring pandas code that joins the life satisfaction data from the OECD
           with the GDP per capita data from the IMF.                 
          7 It’s OK if you don’t understand all the code yet; we will present Scikit-Learn in the following chapters.
