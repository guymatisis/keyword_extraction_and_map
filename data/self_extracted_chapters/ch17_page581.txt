                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Denoising Autoencoders                                      
                                                                      
          Another way to force the autoencoder to learn useful features is to add noise to its
          inputs, training it to recover the original, noise-free inputs. This idea has been around
          since the 1980s (e.g., it is mentioned in Yann LeCun’s 1987 master’s thesis). In a 2008
          paper,5 Pascal Vincent et al. showed that autoencoders could also be used for feature
          extraction. In a 2010 paper,6 Vincent et al. introduced stacked denoising autoencoders.
                                                                      
          The noise can be pure Gaussian noise added to the inputs, or it can be randomly
          switched-off inputs, just like in dropout (introduced in Chapter 11). Figure 17-8
          shows both options.

          The implementation is straightforward: it is a regular stacked autoencoder with an
          additional Dropout layer applied to the encoder’s inputs (or you could use a Gaus
          sianNoise layer instead). Recall that the Dropout layer is only active during training
                                                                      
          (and so is the GaussianNoise layer):
