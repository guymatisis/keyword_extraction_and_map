          more images from the MNIST dataset.

          But wait! You should always create a test set and set it aside before inspecting the data
          closely. The MNIST dataset is actually already split into a training set (the first 60,000
          images) and a test set (the last 10,000 images):            
                                                                      
            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[:60000], X[60000:], y[:60000], y[60000:]
          The training set is already shuffled for us, which is good because this guarantees that
          all cross-validation folds will be similar (you don’t want one fold to be missing some
          digits). Moreover, some learning algorithms are sensitive to the order of the training
          instances, and they perform poorly if they get many similar instances in a row. Shuf‐
          fling the dataset ensures that this won’t happen.2          
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          2 Shuffling may be a bad idea in some contexts—for example, if you are working on time series data (such as
           stock market prices or weather conditions). We will explore this in the next chapters.
