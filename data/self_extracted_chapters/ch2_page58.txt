California housing prices: red is expensive, blue is cheap, larger circles indi‐
          cate areas with a larger population                         
                                                                      
          This image tells you that the housing prices are very much related to the location
          (e.g., close to the ocean) and to the population density, as you probably knew already.
          A clustering algorithm should be useful for detecting the main cluster and for adding
          new features that measure the proximity to the cluster centers. The ocean proximity
          attribute may be useful as well, although in Northern California the housing prices in
          coastal districts are not too high, so it is not a simple rule.
          Looking for Correlations                                    
                                                                      
          Since the dataset is not too large, you can easily compute the standard correlation
          coefficient (also called Pearson’s r) between every pair of attributes using the corr()
          method:                                                     
                                                                      
            corr_matrix = housing.corr()                              
          Now let’s look at how much each attribute correlates with the median house value:
            >>> corr_matrix["median_house_value"].sort_values(ascending=False)
            median_house_value 1.000000                               
            median_income 0.687170                                    
            total_rooms  0.135231                                     
            housing_median_age 0.114220
