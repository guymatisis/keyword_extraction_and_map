Vector arithmetic for visual concepts (part of figure 7 from the DCGAN
          paper)14                                                    
                                                                      
                   If you add each image’s class as an extra input to both the generator
                   and the discriminator, they will both learn what each class looks
                   like, and thus you will be able to control the class of each image
                   produced by the generator. This is called a conditional GAN15
                   (CGAN).                                            
                                                                      
          DCGANs aren’t perfect, though. For example, when you try to generate very large
          images using DCGANs, you often end up with locally convincing features but overall
          inconsistencies (such as shirts with one sleeve much longer than the other). How can
          you fix this?                                               
          Progressive Growing of GANs                                 
                                                                      
          An important technique was proposed in a 2018 paper16 by Nvidia researchers Tero
          Karras et al.: they suggested generating small images at the beginning of training,
          then gradually adding convolutional layers to both the generator and the discrimina‐
          tor to produce larger and larger images (4 × 4, 8 × 8, 16 × 16, …, 512 × 512, 1,024 ×
          1,024). This approach resembles greedy layer-wise training of stacked autoencoders.
