          You Only Look Once (YOLO)                                   
                                                                      
          YOLO is an extremely fast and accurate object detection architecture proposed by
          Joseph Redmon et al. in a 2015 paper,28 and subsequently improved in 201629
          (YOLOv2) and in 201830 (YOLOv3). It is so fast that it can run in real time on a video,
          as seen in Redmon’s demo.                                   
                                                                      
          YOLOv3’s architecture is quite similar to the one we just discussed, but with a few
          important differences:
