          neurons in the previous layer located in rows i to i + f – 1, columns j to j + f – 1,
                                          h             w             
          where f and f are the height and width of the receptive field (see Figure 14-3). In
              h   w                                                   
          order for a layer to have the same height and width as the previous layer, it is com‐
          mon to add zeros around the inputs, as shown in the diagram. This is called zero
          padding.

          It is also possible to connect a large input layer to a much smaller layer by spacing out
          the receptive fields, as shown in Figure 14-4. This dramatically reduces the model’s
          computational complexity. The shift from one receptive field to the next is called the
          stride. In the diagram, a 5 × 7 input layer (plus zero padding) is connected to a 3 × 4
          layer, using 3 × 3 receptive fields and a stride of 2 (in this example the stride is the
          same in both directions, but it does not have to be so). A neuron located in row i,
          column j in the upper layer is connected to the outputs of the neurons in the previous
          layer located in rows i × s to i × s + f – 1, columns j × s to j × s + f – 1, where s
                         h    h h           w    w w       h          
          and s are the vertical and horizontal strides.              
             w
