ter 10), and get it to output the most likely next purchase. This neural net would
typically be trained on past sequences of purchases across all clients.

This is often tackled using Reinforcement Learning (RL; see Chapter 18), which
is a branch of Machine Learning that trains agents (such as bots) to pick the
actions that will maximize their rewards over time (e.g., a bot may get a reward
every time the player loses some life points), within a given environment (such as
the game). The famous AlphaGo program that beat the world champion at the
game of Go was built using RL.
This list could go on and on, but hopefully it gives you a sense of the incredible
breadth and complexity of the tasks that Machine Learning can tackle, and the types
of techniques that you would use for each task.

There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to
classify them in broad categories, based on the following criteria:
• Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsuper‐
vised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)
• Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch
learning)
• Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points,
or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive
model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)
These criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like. For
example, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural net‐
work model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model-
based, supervised learning system.
Let’s look at each of these criteria a bit more closely.

Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of
supervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement
Learning.
