          Since separable convolutional layers only have one spatial filter per input channel,
          you should avoid using them after layers that have too few channels, such as the input
          layer (granted, that’s what Figure 14-19 represents, but it is just for illustration pur‐
          poses). For this reason, the Xception architecture starts with 2 regular convolutional
          layers, but then the rest of the architecture uses only separable convolutions (34 in
          all), plus a few max pooling layers and the usual final layers (a global average pooling
          layer and a dense output layer).                            
                                                                      
          You might wonder why Xception is considered a variant of GoogLeNet, since it con‐
          tains no inception module at all. Well, as we discussed earlier, an inception module
          contains convolutional layers with 1 × 1 filters: these look exclusively for cross-
          channel patterns. However, the convolutional layers that sit on top of them are regu‐
          lar convolutional layers that look both for spatial and cross-channel patterns. So you
          can think of an inception module as an intermediate between a regular convolutional
          layer (which considers spatial patterns and cross-channel patterns jointly) and a sepa‐
          rable convolutional layer (which considers them separately). In practice, it seems that
          separable convolutional layers generally perform better.
