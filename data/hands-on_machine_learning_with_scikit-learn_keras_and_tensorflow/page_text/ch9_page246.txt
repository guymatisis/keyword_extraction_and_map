<i>Figure</i> <i>9-7.</i> <i>Bad</i> <i>choices</i> <i>for</i> <i>the</i> <i>number</i> <i>of</i> <i>clusters:</i> <i>when</i> <i>k</i> <i>is</i> <i>too</i> <i>small,</i> <i>separate</i> <i>clusters</i>

You might be thinking that we could just pick the model with the lowest inertia,
right? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. The inertia for <i>k=3</i> is 653.2, which is much
higher than for <i>k=5</i> (which was 211.6). But with <i>k=8,</i> the inertia is just 119.1. The
inertia is not a good performance metric when trying to choose <i>k</i> because it keeps
getting lower as we increase <i>k.</i> Indeed, the more clusters there are, the closer each
instance will be to its closest centroid, and therefore the lower the inertia will be. Let’s
plot the inertia as a function of <i>k</i> (see Figure 9-8).
<i>Figure</i> <i>9-8.</i> <i>When</i> <i>plotting</i> <i>the</i> <i>inertia</i> <i>as</i> <i>a</i> <i>function</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>number</i> <i>of</i> <i>clusters</i> <i>k,</i> <i>the</i> <i>curve</i>
<i>often</i> <i>contains</i> <i>an</i> <i>inflexion</i> <i>point</i> <i>called</i> <i>the</i> <i>“elbow”</i>
As you can see, the inertia drops very quickly as we increase <i>k</i> up to 4, but then it
decreases much more slowly as we keep increasing <i>k.</i> This curve has roughly the
shape of an arm, and there is an “elbow” at <i>k</i> = 4. So, if we did not know better, 4
would be a good choice: any lower value would be dramatic, while any higher value
would not help much, and we might just be splitting perfectly good clusters in half for
no good reason.
This technique for choosing the best value for the number of clusters is rather coarse.
A more precise approach (but also more computationally expensive) is to use the
<i>silhouette</i> <i>score,</i> which is the mean <i>silhouette</i> <i>coefficient</i> over all the instances. An
