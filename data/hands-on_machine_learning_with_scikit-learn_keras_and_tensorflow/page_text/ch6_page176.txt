                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          You can visualize the trained Decision Tree by first using the export_graphviz()
          method to output a graph definition file called iris_tree.dot:
                                                                      
            from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz                  
            export_graphviz(                                          
                 tree_clf,                                            
                 out_file=image_path("iris_tree.dot"),                
                 feature_names=iris.feature_names[2:],                
                 class_names=iris.target_names,                       
                 rounded=True,                                        
                 filled=True                                          
               )                                                      
          Then you can use the dot command-line tool from the Graphviz package to convert
          this .dot file to a variety of formats, such as PDF or PNG.1 This command line con‐
          verts the .dot file to a .png image file:                   
            $ dot -Tpng iris_tree.dot -o iris_tree.png                
          Your first Decision Tree looks like Figure 6-1.             
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 6-1. Iris Decision Tree                              
                                                                      
          Making Predictions                                          
                                                                      
          Let’s see how the tree represented in Figure 6-1 makes predictions. Suppose you find
          an iris flower and you want to classify it. You start at the root node (depth 0, at the
          top): this node asks whether the flower’s petal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If it is,
          then you move down to the root’s left child node (depth 1, left). In this case, it is a leaf
