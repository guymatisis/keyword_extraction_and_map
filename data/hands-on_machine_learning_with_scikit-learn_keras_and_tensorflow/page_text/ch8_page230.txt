                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          You can then compute the reconstruction pre-image error:    
                                                                      
            >>> from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error        
            >>> mean_squared_error(X, X_preimage)                     
            32.786308795766132                                        
          Now you can use grid search with cross-validation to find the kernel and hyperpara‐
          meters that minimize this error.                            
          LLE                                                         
                                                                      
          Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)8 is another powerful nonlinear dimensionality reduc‐
          tion (NLDR) technique. It is a Manifold Learning technique that does not rely on
          projections, like the previous algorithms do. In a nutshell, LLE works by first measur‐
          ing how each training instance linearly relates to its closest neighbors (c.n.), and then
          looking for a low-dimensional representation of the training set where these local
          relationships are best preserved (more details shortly). This approach makes it partic‐
          ularly good at unrolling twisted manifolds, especially when there is not too much
          noise.                                                      
                                                                      
          The following code uses Scikit-Learn’s LocallyLinearEmbedding class to unroll the
          Swiss roll:                                                 
            from sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding       
                                                                      
            lle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_components=2, n_neighbors=10)
            X_reduced = lle.fit_transform(X)                          
          The resulting 2D dataset is shown in Figure 8-12. As you can see, the Swiss roll is
          completely unrolled, and the distances between instances are locally well preserved.
          However, distances are not preserved on a larger scale: the left part of the unrolled
          Swiss roll is stretched, while the right part is squeezed. Nevertheless, LLE did a pretty
          good job at modeling the manifold.
