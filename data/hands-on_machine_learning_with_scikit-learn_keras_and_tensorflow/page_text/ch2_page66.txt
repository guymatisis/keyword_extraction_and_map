          It’s not arbitrary text: there are a limited number of possible values, each of which
          represents a category. So this attribute is a categorical attribute. Most Machine Learn‐
          ing algorithms prefer to work with numbers, so let’s convert these categories from
          text to numbers. For this, we can use Scikit-Learn’s OrdinalEncoder class:19
            >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder      
            >>> ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder()                    
            >>> housing_cat_encoded = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat)
            >>> housing_cat_encoded[:10]                              
            array([[0.],                                              
                [0.],                                                 
                [4.],                                                 
                [1.],                                                 
                [0.],                                                 
                [1.],                                                 
                [0.],                                                 
                [1.],                                                 
                [0.],                                                 
                [0.]])                                                
          You can get the list of categories using the categories_ instance variable. It is a list
          containing a 1D array of categories for each categorical attribute (in this case, a list
          containing a single array since there is just one categorical attribute):
            >>> ordinal_encoder.categories_                           
            [array(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND', 'ISLAND', 'NEAR BAY', 'NEAR OCEAN'],
                dtype=object)]                                        
          One issue with this representation is that ML algorithms will assume that two nearby
          values are more similar than two distant values. This may be fine in some cases (e.g.,
          for ordered categories such as “bad,” “average,” “good,” and “excellent”), but it is obvi‐
          ously not the case for the ocean_proximity column (for example, categories 0 and 4
          are clearly more similar than categories 0 and 1). To fix this issue, a common solution
          19 This class is available in Scikit-Learn 0.20 and later. If you use an earlier version, please consider upgrading, or
           use the pandas Series.factorize() method.
