                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Let’s try to build a classifier to detect the Iris virginica type based only on the petal
          width feature. First let’s load the data:                   
                                                                      
            >>> from sklearn import datasets                          
            >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()                           
            >>> list(iris.keys())                                     
            ['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names', 'filename']
            >>> X = iris["data"][:, 3:] # petal width                 
            >>> y = (iris["target"] == 2).astype(np.int) # 1 if Iris virginica, else 0
          Now let’s train a Logistic Regression model:                
            from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression       
            log_reg = LogisticRegression()                            
            log_reg.fit(X, y)                                         
          Let’s look at the model’s estimated probabilities for flowers with petal widths varying
          from 0 cm to 3 cm (Figure 4-23):15                          
            X_new = np.linspace(0, 3, 1000).reshape(-1, 1)            
            y_proba = log_reg.predict_proba(X_new)                    
            plt.plot(X_new, y_proba[:, 1], "g-", label="Iris virginica")
            plt.plot(X_new, y_proba[:, 0], "b--", label="Not Iris virginica")
            # + more Matplotlib code to make the image look pretty    
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 4-23. Estimated probabilities and decision boundary  
                                                                      
          The petal width of Iris virginica flowers (represented by triangles) ranges from 1.4 cm
          to 2.5 cm, while the other iris flowers (represented by squares) generally have a
          smaller petal width, ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.8 cm. Notice that there is a bit of over‐
          lap. Above about 2 cm the classifier is highly confident that the flower is an Iris virgin‐
          ica (it outputs a high probability for that class), while below 1 cm it is highly
          confident that it is not an Iris virginica (high probability for the “Not Iris virginica”
                                                                      
                                                                      
          15 NumPy’s reshape() function allows one dimension to be –1, which means “unspecified”: the value is inferred
           from the length of the array and the remaining dimensions.
