                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          thus, simple patterns in the data may end up being distorted by this sequence of
          transformations.

          Let’s build such a neural network to tackle the California housing problem:
                                                                      
            input_ = keras.layers.Input(shape=X_train.shape[1:])      
            hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu")(input_)
            hidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(30, activation="relu")(hidden1)
            concat = keras.layers.Concatenate()([input_, hidden2])    
            output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(concat)                    
            model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_], outputs=[output])    
          Let’s go through each line of this code:                    
           • First, we need to create an Input object.18 This is a specification of the kind of
            input the model will get, including its shape and dtype. A model may actually
            have multiple inputs, as we will see shortly.             
           • Next, we create a Dense layer with 30 neurons, using the ReLU activation func‐
            tion. As soon as it is created, notice that we call it like a function, passing it the
            input. This is why this is called the Functional API. Note that we are just telling
            Keras how it should connect the layers together; no actual data is being processed
            yet.                                                      
           • We then create a second hidden layer, and again we use it as a function. Note that
            we pass it the output of the first hidden layer.          
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          18 The name input_ is used to avoid overshadowing Python’s built-in input() function.
