                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          function, and it generates the tf__sum_squares() function. In this function, the for
          loop is replaced by the definition of the loop_body() function (containing the body
          of the original for loop), followed by a call to the for_stmt() function. This call will
          build the appropriate tf.while_loop() operation in the computation graph.
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 12-4. How TensorFlow generates graphs using AutoGraph and tracing
                                                                      
          Next, TensorFlow calls this “upgraded” function, but instead of passing the argument,
          it passes a symbolic tensor—a tensor without any actual value, only a name, a data
          type, and a shape. For example, if you call sum_squares(tf.constant(10)), then the
          tf__sum_squares() function will be called with a symbolic tensor of type int32 and
          shape []. The function will run in graph mode, meaning that each TensorFlow opera‐
          tion will add a node in the graph to represent itself and its output tensor(s) (as
          opposed to the regular mode, called eager execution, or eager mode). In graph mode,
          TF operations do not perform any computations. This should feel familiar if you
          know TensorFlow 1, as graph mode was the default mode. In Figure 12-4, you can see
          the tf__sum_squares() function being called with a symbolic tensor as its argument
          (in this case, an int32 tensor of shape []) and the final graph being generated during
          tracing. The nodes represent operations, and the arrows represent tensors (both the
          generated function and the graph are simplified).
