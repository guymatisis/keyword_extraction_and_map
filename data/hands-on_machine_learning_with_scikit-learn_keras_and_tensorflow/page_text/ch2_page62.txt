And now let’s look at the correlation matrix again:

Hey, not bad! The new bedrooms_per_room attribute is much more correlated with
the median house value than the total number of rooms or bedrooms. Apparently
houses with a lower bedroom/room ratio tend to be more expensive. The number of
rooms per household is also more informative than the total number of rooms in a
district—obviously the larger the houses, the more expensive they are.
This round of exploration does not have to be absolutely thorough; the point is to
start off on the right foot and quickly gain insights that will help you get a first rea‐
sonably good prototype. But this is an iterative process: once you get a prototype up
and running, you can analyze its output to gain more insights and come back to this
exploration step.

It’s time to prepare the data for your Machine Learning algorithms. Instead of doing
this manually, you should write functions for this purpose, for several good reasons:
• This will allow you to reproduce these transformations easily on any dataset (e.g.,
the next time you get a fresh dataset).
• You will gradually build a library of transformation functions that you can reuse
in future projects.
• You can use these functions in your live system to transform the new data before
feeding it to your algorithms.
