<i>Figure</i> <i>1-7.</i> <i>An</i> <i>unlabeled</i> <i>training</i> <i>set</i> <i>for</i> <i>unsupervised</i> <i>learning</i>
Here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms (most of
these are covered in Chapters 8 and 9):
• Clustering
— K-Means
— DBSCAN
— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
• Anomaly detection and novelty detection
— One-class SVM
— Isolation Forest
• Visualization and dimensionality reduction
— Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
— Kernel PCA
— Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
— t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
• Association rule learning
— Apriori
— Eclat
For example, say you have a lot of data about your blog’s visitors. You may want to
run a <i>clustering</i> algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors (Figure 1-8). At
no point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those
connections without your help. For example, it might notice that 40% of your visitors
are males who love comic books and generally read your blog in the evening, while
20% are young sci-fi lovers who visit during the weekends. If you use a <i>hierarchical</i>
<i>clustering</i> algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller groups. This may
help you target your posts for each group.
