          For example, say you have a lot of data about your blog’s visitors. You may want to
          run a clustering algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors (Figure 1-8). At
          no point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those
          connections without your help. For example, it might notice that 40% of your visitors
          are males who love comic books and generally read your blog in the evening, while
          20% are young sci-fi lovers who visit during the weekends. If you use a hierarchical
          clustering algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller groups. This may
          help you target your posts for each group.
