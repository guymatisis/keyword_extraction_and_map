                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Download the Data                                           
                                                                      
          In typical environments your data would be available in a relational database (or
          some other common data store) and spread across multiple tables/documents/files.
          To access it, you would first need to get your credentials and access authorizations10
          and familiarize yourself with the data schema. In this project, however, things are
          much simpler: you will just download a single compressed file, housing.tgz, which
          contains a comma-separated values (CSV) file called housing.csv with all the data.
          You could use your web browser to download the file and run tar xzf housing.tgz
          to decompress it and extract the CSV file, but it is preferable to create a small func‐
          tion to do that. Having a function that downloads the data is useful in particular if the
          data changes regularly: you can write a small script that uses the function to fetch the
          latest data (or you can set up a scheduled job to do that automatically at regular inter‐
          vals). Automating the process of fetching the data is also useful if you need to install
          the dataset on multiple machines.                           
          Here is the function to fetch the data:11                   
                                                                      
            import os                                                 
            import tarfile                                            
            import urllib                                             
            DOWNLOAD_ROOT = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/"
            HOUSING_PATH = os.path.join("datasets", "housing")        
            HOUSING_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "datasets/housing/housing.tgz"
            def fetch_housing_data(housing_url=HOUSING_URL, housing_path=HOUSING_PATH):
               os.makedirs(housing_path, exist_ok=True)               
               tgz_path = os.path.join(housing_path, "housing.tgz")   
               urllib.request.urlretrieve(housing_url, tgz_path)      
               housing_tgz = tarfile.open(tgz_path)                   
               housing_tgz.extractall(path=housing_path)              
               housing_tgz.close()                                    
          Now when you call fetch_housing_data(), it creates a datasets/housing directory in
          your workspace, downloads the housing.tgz file, and extracts the housing.csv file from
          it in this directory.                                       
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          10 You might also need to check legal constraints, such as private fields that should never be copied to unsafe
           data stores.                                               
          11 In a real project you would save this code in a Python file, but for now you can just write it in your Jupyter
           notebook.
