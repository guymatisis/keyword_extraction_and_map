          Note that the number of feature maps is doubled every few residual units, at the same
          time as their height and width are halved (using a convolutional layer with stride 2).
          When this happens, the inputs cannot be added directly to the outputs of the residual
          unit because they don’t have the same shape (for example, this problem affects the
          skip connection represented by the dashed arrow in Figure 14-17). To solve this prob‐
          lem, the inputs are passed through a 1 × 1 convolutional layer with stride 2 and the
          right number of output feature maps (see Figure 14-18).
