<i>Visualization</i> algorithms are also good examples of unsupervised learning algorithms:
you feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D rep‐
resentation of your data that can easily be plotted (Figure 1-9). These algorithms try
to preserve as much structure as they can (e.g., trying to keep separate clusters in the
input space from overlapping in the visualization) so that you can understand how
the data is organized and perhaps identify unsuspected patterns.
