                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Estimating Probabilities                                    
                                                                      
          So how does Logistic Regression work? Just like a Linear Regression model, a Logistic
          Regression model computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term),
          but instead of outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression model does, it
          outputs the logistic of this result (see Equation 4-13).    
                                                                      
            Equation 4-13. Logistic Regression model estimated probability (vectorized form)
                     ⊺                                                
            p=h x =σ x θ

          The logistic—noted σ(·)—is a sigmoid function (i.e., S-shaped) that outputs a number
          between 0 and 1. It is defined as shown in Equation 4-14 and Figure 4-21.

            σ t =

          Figure 4-21. Logistic function                              
                                                                      
          Once the Logistic Regression model has estimated the probability p = h (x) that an

          instance x belongs to the positive class, it can make its prediction ŷ easily (see Equa‐
          tion 4-15).                                                 
            Equation 4-15. Logistic Regression model prediction       
               0 if p<0.5                                             
            y =                                                       
               1 if p≥0.5                                             
                                                                      
          Notice that σ(t) < 0.5 when t < 0, and σ(t) ≥ 0.5 when t ≥ 0, so a Logistic Regression
          model predicts 1 if x⊺ θ is positive and 0 if it is negative.
