GridSearchCV
c. Use grid search with cross-validation (with the help of the
class) to find good hyperparameter values for a DecisionTreeClassifier .
max_leaf_nodes.
Hint: try various values for
d. Train it on the full training set using these hyperparameters, and measure
your model’s performance on the test set. You should get roughly 85% to 87%
accuracy.
8. Grow a forest by following these steps:
a. Continuing the previous exercise, generate 1,000 subsets of the training set,
each containing 100 instances selected randomly. Hint: you can use Scikit-
Learn’s ShuffleSplit class for this.
b. Train one Decision Tree on each subset, using the best hyperparameter values
found in the previous exercise. Evaluate these 1,000 Decision Trees on the test
set. Since they were trained on smaller sets, these Decision Trees will likely
perform worse than the first Decision Tree, achieving only about 80%
accuracy.
c. Now comes the magic. For each test set instance, generate the predictions of
the 1,000 Decision Trees, and keep only the most frequent prediction (you can
mode()
use SciPy’s function for this). This approach gives you <i>majority-vote</i>
<i>predictions</i> over the test set.
d. Evaluate these predictions on the test set: you should obtain a slightly higher
accuracy than your first model (about 0.5 to 1.5% higher). Congratulations,
you have trained a Random Forest classifier!
Solutions to these exercises are available in Appendix A.
