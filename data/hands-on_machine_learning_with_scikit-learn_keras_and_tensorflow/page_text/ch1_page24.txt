In a famous paper published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele Banko and Eric
Brill showed that very different Machine Learning algorithms, including fairly simple
ones, performed almost identically well on a complex problem of natural language
disambiguation 8 once they were given enough data (as you can see in Figure 1-20).

As the authors put it, “these results suggest that we may want to reconsider the trade-
off between spending time and money on algorithm development versus spending it
on corpus development.”
The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems was further
popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness
of Data”, published in 2009.10 It should be noted, however, that small- and medium-
sized datasets are still very common, and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra
training data—so don’t abandon algorithms just yet.
