The most important building block of a CNN is the <i>convolutional</i> <i>layer:6</i> neurons in
the first convolutional layer are not connected to every single pixel in the input image
(like they were in the layers discussed in previous chapters), but only to pixels in their
receptive fields (see Figure 14-2). In turn, each neuron in the second convolutional
layer is connected only to neurons located within a small rectangle in the first layer.
This architecture allows the network to concentrate on small low-level features in the
first hidden layer, then assemble them into larger higher-level features in the next
hidden layer, and so on. This hierarchical structure is common in real-world images,
which is one of the reasons why CNNs work so well for image recognition.

All the multilayer neural networks weâ€™ve looked at so far had layers
composed of a long line of neurons, and we had to flatten input
images to 1D before feeding them to the neural network. In a CNN
each layer is represented in 2D, which makes it easier to match
neurons with their corresponding inputs.
