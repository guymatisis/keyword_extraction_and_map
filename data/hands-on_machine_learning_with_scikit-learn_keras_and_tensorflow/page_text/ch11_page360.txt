As we discussed in Chapter 10, you can find a good learning rate by training the
model for a few hundred iterations, exponentially increasing the learning rate from a
very small value to a very large value, and then looking at the learning curve and
picking a learning rate slightly lower than the one at which the learning curve starts
shooting back up. You can then reinitialize your model and train it with that learning
rate.
But you can do better than a constant learning rate: if you start with a large learning
rate and then reduce it once training stops making fast progress, you can reach a
good solution faster than with the optimal constant learning rate. There are many dif‐
ferent strategies to reduce the learning rate during training. It can also be beneficial to
start with a low learning rate, increase it, then drop it again. These strategies are
called <i>learning</i> <i>schedules</i> (we briefly introduced this concept in Chapter 4). These are
the most commonly used learning schedules:
<i>Power</i> <i>scheduling</i>
<i>c</i>
Set the learning rate to a function of the iteration number <i>t:</i> <i>η(t)</i> = <i>η</i> / (1 + <i>t/s)</i> .
0
The initial learning rate <i>η</i> , the power <i>c</i> (typically set to 1), and the steps <i>s</i> are
0
hyperparameters. The learning rate drops at each step. After <i>s</i> steps, it is down to
<i>η</i> / 2. After <i>s</i> more steps, it is down to <i>η</i> / 3, then it goes down to <i>η</i> / 4, then <i>η</i> /
0 0 0 0
5, and so on. As you can see, this schedule first drops quickly, then more and
more slowly. Of course, power scheduling requires tuning <i>η</i> and <i>s</i> (and possibly
0
<i>c).</i>
<i>Exponential</i> <i>scheduling</i>
<i>t/s</i>
Set the learning rate to <i>η(t)</i> = <i>η</i> 0.1 . The learning rate will gradually drop by a
0
factor of 10 every <i>s</i> steps. While power scheduling reduces the learning rate more
and more slowly, exponential scheduling keeps slashing it by a factor of 10 every
<i>s</i> steps.
