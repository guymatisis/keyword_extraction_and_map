          Generative adversarial networks were proposed in a 2014 paper10 by Ian Goodfellow
          et al., and although the idea got researchers excited almost instantly, it took a few
          years to overcome some of the difficulties of training GANs. Like many great ideas, it
          seems simple in hindsight: make neural networks compete against each other in the
          hope that this competition will push them to excel. As shown in Figure 17-15, a GAN
          is composed of two neural networks:                         
                                                                      
          Generator                                                   
            Takes a random distribution as input (typically Gaussian) and outputs some data
            —typically, an image. You can think of the random inputs as the latent represen‐
            tations (i.e., codings) of the image to be generated. So, as you can see, the genera‐
            tor offers the same functionality as a decoder in a variational autoencoder, and it
            can be used in the same way to generate new images (just feed it some Gaussian
            noise, and it outputs a brand-new image). However, it is trained very differently,
            as we will soon see.                                      
          Discriminator                                               
            Takes either a fake image from the generator or a real image from the training set
            as input, and must guess whether the input image is fake or real.
