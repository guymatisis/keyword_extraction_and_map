                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          default with the Python binary installers (since Python 2.7.9).6 You can check to see if
          pip is installed by typing the following command:           
                                                                      
            $ python3 -m pip --version                                
            pip 19.3.1 from [...]/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
          You should make sure you have a recent version of pip installed. To upgrade the pip
          module, type the following (the exact version may differ):7 
            $ python3 -m pip install --user -U pip                    
            Collecting pip                                            
            [...]                                                     
            Successfully installed pip-19.3.1                         
                                                                      
                       Creating an Isolated Environment               
           If you would like to work in an isolated environment (which is strongly recom‐
           mended so that you can work on different projects without having conflicting library
           versions), install virtualenv8 by running the following pip command (again, if you
           want virtualenv to be installed for all users on your machine, remove --user and run
           this command with administrator rights):                   
             $ python3 -m pip install --user -U virtualenv            
             Collecting virtualenv                                    
             [...]                                                    
             Successfully installed virtualenv-16.7.6                 
           Now you can create an isolated Python environment by typing this:
             $ cd $ML_PATH                                            
             $ python3 -m virtualenv my_env                           
             Using base prefix '[...]'                                
             New python executable in [...]/ml/my_env/bin/python3     
             Also creating executable in [...]/ml/my_env/bin/python   
             Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.                
           Now every time you want to activate this environment, just open a terminal and type
           the following:                                             
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          6 I’ll show the installation steps using pip in a bash shell on a Linux or macOS system. You may need to adapt
           these commands to your own system. On Windows, I recommend installing Anaconda instead.
          7 If you want to upgrade pip for all users on your machine rather than just your own user, you should remove
           the --user option and make sure you have administrator rights (e.g., by adding sudo before the whole com‐
           mand on Linux or macOS).                                   
          8 Alternative tools include venv (very similar to virtualenv and included in the standard library), virtualenv‐
           wrapper (provides extra functionalities on top of virtualenv), pyenv (allows easy switching between Python
           versions), and pipenv (a great packaging tool by the same author as the popular requests library, built on top
           of pip and virtualenv).
