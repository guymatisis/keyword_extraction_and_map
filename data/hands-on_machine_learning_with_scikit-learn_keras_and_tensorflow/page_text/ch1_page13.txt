attributes. For example, suppose you own a supermarket. Running an association rule
on your sales logs may reveal that people who purchase barbecue sauce and potato
chips also tend to buy steak. Thus, you may want to place these items close to one
another.
<b>Semisupervisedlearning</b>
Since labeling data is usually time-consuming and costly, you will often have plenty of
unlabeled instances, and few labeled instances. Some algorithms can deal with data
that’s partially labeled. This is called <i>semisupervised</i> <i>learning</i> (Figure 1-11).
<i>Figure</i> <i>1-11.</i> <i>Semisupervised</i> <i>learning</i> <i>with</i> <i>two</i> <i>classes</i> <i>(triangles</i> <i>and</i> <i>squares):</i> <i>the</i> <i>unla‐</i>
<i>beled</i> <i>examples</i> <i>(circles)</i> <i>help</i> <i>classify</i> <i>a</i> <i>new</i> <i>instance</i> <i>(the</i> <i>cross)</i> <i>into</i> <i>the</i> <i>triangle</i> <i>class</i>
<i>rather</i> <i>than</i> <i>the</i> <i>square</i> <i>class,</i> <i>even</i> <i>though</i> <i>it</i> <i>is</i> <i>closer</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>labeled</i> <i>squares</i>
Some photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this. Once
you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the
same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in
photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all
the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just add one label per per‐
son 4 and it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching
photos.
Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and
supervised algorithms. For example, <i>deep</i> <i>belief</i> <i>networks</i> (DBNs) are based on unsu‐
pervised components called <i>restricted</i> <i>Boltzmann</i> <i>machines</i> (RBMs) stacked on top of
one another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the
whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.
