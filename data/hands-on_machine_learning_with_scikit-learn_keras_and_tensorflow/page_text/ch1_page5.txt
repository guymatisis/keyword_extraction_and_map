correlations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the prob‐
lem. Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover pat‐
terns that were not immediately apparent. This is called <i>data</i> <i>mining.</i>

To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:
• Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of
rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform bet‐
ter than the traditional approach.
• Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solu‐
tion: the best Machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.
• Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
• Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

Let’s look at some concrete examples of Machine Learning tasks, along with the tech‐
niques that can tackle them:
<i>Analyzing</i> <i>images</i> <i>of</i> <i>products</i> <i>on</i> <i>a</i> <i>production</i> <i>line</i> <i>to</i> <i>automatically</i> <i>classify</i> <i>them</i>
This is image classification, typically performed using convolutional neural net‐
works (CNNs; see Chapter 14).
