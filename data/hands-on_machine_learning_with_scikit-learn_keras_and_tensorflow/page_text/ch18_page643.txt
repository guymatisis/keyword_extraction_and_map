                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 18-11.

          Installing TF-Agents                                        
                                                                      
          Let’s start by installing TF-Agents. This can be done using pip (as always, if you are
          using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it first; if not, you will need to use
          the --user option, or have administrator rights):           
            $ python3 -m pip install -U tf-agents                     
                                                                      
                   At the time of this writing, TF-Agents is still quite new and
                   improving every day, so the API may change a bit by the time you
                   read this—but the big picture should remain the same, as well as
                   most of the code. If anything breaks, I will update the Jupyter note‐
                   book accordingly, so make sure to check it out.    
                                                                      
          Next, let’s create a TF-Agents environment that will just wrap OpenAI GGym’s Break‐
          out environment. For this, you must first install OpenAI Gym’s Atari dependencies:
            $ python3 -m pip install -U 'gym[atari]'                  
          Among other libraries, this command will install atari-py, which is a Python inter‐
          face for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), a framework built on top of the
          Atari 2600 emulator Stella.                                 
                                                                      
          TF-Agents Environments                                      
                                                                      
          If everything went well, you should be able to import TF-Agents and create a Break‐
          out environment:                                            
            >>> from tf_agents.environments import suite_gym          
            >>> env = suite_gym.load("Breakout-v4")                   
            >>> env                                                   
            <tf_agents.environments.wrappers.TimeLimit at 0x10c523c18>
