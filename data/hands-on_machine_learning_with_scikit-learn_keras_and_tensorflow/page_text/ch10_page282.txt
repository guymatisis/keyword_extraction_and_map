          Thus, individual biological neurons seem to behave in a rather simple way, but they
          are organized in a vast network of billions, with each neuron typically connected to
          thousands of other neurons. Highly complex computations can be performed by a
          network of fairly simple neurons, much like a complex anthill can emerge from the
          combined efforts of simple ants. The architecture of biological neural networks
          (BNNs)5 is still the subject of active research, but some parts of the brain have been
          mapped, and it seems that neurons are often organized in consecutive layers, espe‐
          cially in the cerebral cortex (i.e., the outer layer of your brain), as shown in
          Figure 10-2.
