                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          that was either less than 49% female or more than 54% female. Either way, the survey
          results would be significantly biased.                      
                                                                      
          Suppose you chatted with experts who told you that the median income is a very
          important attribute to predict median housing prices. You may want to ensure that
          the test set is representative of the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset.
          Since the median income is a continuous numerical attribute, you first need to create
          an income category attribute. Let’s look at the median income histogram more closely
          (back in Figure 2-8): most median income values are clustered around 1.5 to 6 (i.e.,
          $15,000–$60,000), but some median incomes go far beyond 6. It is important to have
          a sufficient number of instances in your dataset for each stratum, or else the estimate
          of a stratum’s importance may be biased. This means that you should not have too
          many strata, and each stratum should be large enough. The following code uses the
          pd.cut() function to create an income category attribute with five categories (labeled
          from 1 to 5): category 1 ranges from 0 to 1.5 (i.e., less than $15,000), category 2 from
          1.5 to 3, and so on:                                        
            housing["income_cat"] = pd.cut(housing["median_income"],  
                              bins=[0., 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6., np.inf],   
                              labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])                 
          These income categories are represented in Figure 2-9:      
            housing["income_cat"].hist()                              
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 2-9. Histogram of income categories                  
                                                                      
          Now you are ready to do stratified sampling based on the income category. For this
          you can use Scikit-Learn’s StratifiedShuffleSplit class:
