Note that there may not be any positive rewards at all; for example, the agent may
move around in a maze, getting a negative reward at every time step, so it had better
find the exit as quickly as possible! There are many other examples of tasks to which
Reinforcement Learning is well suited, such as self-driving cars, recommender sys‐
tems, placing ads on a web page, or controlling where an image classification system
should focus its attention.
