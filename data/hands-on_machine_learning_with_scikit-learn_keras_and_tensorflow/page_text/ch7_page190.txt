          A very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of
          each classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes. This majority-vote classi‐
          fier is called a hard voting classifier (see Figure 7-2).

          Somewhat surprisingly, this voting classifier often achieves a higher accuracy than the
          best classifier in the ensemble. In fact, even if each classifier is a weak learner (mean‐
          ing it does only slightly better than random guessing), the ensemble can still be a
          strong learner (achieving high accuracy), provided there are a sufficient number of
          weak learners and they are sufficiently diverse.
