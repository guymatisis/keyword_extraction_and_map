                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 2-7. Summary of each numerical attribute             
          The count, mean, min, and max rows are self-explanatory. Note that the null values are
                                                                      
          ignored (so, for example, the count of total_bedrooms is 20,433, not 20,640). The
          std row shows the standard deviation, which measures how dispersed the values are.12
          The 25%, 50%, and 75% rows show the corresponding percentiles: a percentile indi‐
          cates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observa‐
          tions fall. For example, 25% of the districts have a housing_median_age lower than
          18, while 50% are lower than 29 and 75% are lower than 37. These are often called the
          25th percentile (or first quartile), the median, and the 75th percentile (or third
          quartile).                                                  
          Another quick way to get a feel of the type of data you are dealing with is to plot a
          histogram for each numerical attribute. A histogram shows the number of instances
          (on the vertical axis) that have a given value range (on the horizontal axis). You can
          either plot this one attribute at a time, or you can call the hist() method on the
          whole dataset (as shown in the following code example), and it will plot a histogram
          for each numerical attribute (see Figure 2-8):              
            %matplotlib inline # only in a Jupyter notebook           
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                           
            housing.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20,15))                    
            plt.show()                                                
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          12 The standard deviation is generally denoted σ (the Greek letter sigma), and it is the square root of the var‐
           iance, which is the average of the squared deviation from the mean. When a feature has a bell-shaped normal
           distribution (also called a Gaussian distribution), which is very common, the “68-95-99.7” rule applies: about
           68% of the values fall within 1σ of the mean, 95% within 2σ, and 99.7% within 3σ.
