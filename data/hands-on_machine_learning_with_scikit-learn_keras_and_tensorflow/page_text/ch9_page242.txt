Although the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it may not converge to the right
solution (i.e., it may converge to a local optimum): whether it does or not depends on
the centroid initialization. Figure 9-5 shows two suboptimal solutions that the algo‐
rithm can converge to if you are not lucky with the random initialization step.

Let’s look at a few ways you can mitigate this risk by improving the centroid
initialization.
