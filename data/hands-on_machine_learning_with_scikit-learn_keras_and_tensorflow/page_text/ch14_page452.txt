          Specifically, a neuron located in row i, column j of the feature map k in a given convo‐
          lutional layer l is connected to the outputs of the neurons in the previous layer l – 1,
          located in rows i × s to i × s + f – 1 and columns j × s to j × s + f – 1, across all

          feature maps (in layer l – 1). Note that all neurons located in the same row i and col‐
          umn j but in different feature maps are connected to the outputs of the exact same
          neurons in the previous layer.                              
          Equation 14-1 summarizes the preceding explanations in one big mathematical equa‐
          tion: it shows how to compute the output of a given neuron in a convolutional layer.
