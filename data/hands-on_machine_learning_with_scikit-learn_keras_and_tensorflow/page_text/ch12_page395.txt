Custom model example: an arbitrary model with a custom ResidualBlock
          layer containing a skip connection                          
                                                                      
          The inputs go through a first dense layer, then through a residual block composed of
          two dense layers and an addition operation (as we will see in Chapter 14, a residual
          block adds its inputs to its outputs), then through this same residual block three more
          times, then through a second residual block, and the final result goes through a dense
          output layer. Note that this model does not make much sense; it’s just an example to
          illustrate the fact that you can easily build any kind of model you want, even one that
          contains loops and skip connections. To implement this model, it is best to first create
          a ResidualBlock layer, since we are going to create a couple of identical blocks (and
          we might want to reuse it in another model):                
            class ResidualBlock(keras.layers.Layer):                  
               def __init__(self, n_layers, n_neurons, **kwargs):     
                 super().__init__(**kwargs)                           
                 self.hidden = [keras.layers.Dense(n_neurons, activation="elu",
                                     kernel_initializer="he_normal")  
                          for _ in range(n_layers)]                   
               def call(self, inputs):                                
                 Z = inputs                                           
                 for layer in self.hidden:                            
                   Z = layer(Z)                                       
                 return inputs + Z                                    
          This layer is a bit special since it contains other layers. This is handled transparently
          by Keras: it automatically detects that the hidden attribute contains trackable objects
          (layers in this case), so their variables are automatically added to this layer’s list of
