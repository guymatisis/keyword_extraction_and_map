                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Chaining Transformations                                    
                                                                      
          Once you have a dataset, you can apply all sorts of transformations to it by calling its
          transformation methods. Each method returns a new dataset, so you can chain trans‐
          formations like this (this chain is illustrated in Figure 13-1):
            >>> dataset = dataset.repeat(3).batch(7)                  
            >>> for item in dataset:                                  
            ...  print(item)                                          
            ...                                                       
            tf.Tensor([0 1 2 3 4 5 6], shape=(7,), dtype=int32)       
            tf.Tensor([7 8 9 0 1 2 3], shape=(7,), dtype=int32)       
            tf.Tensor([4 5 6 7 8 9 0], shape=(7,), dtype=int32)       
            tf.Tensor([1 2 3 4 5 6 7], shape=(7,), dtype=int32)       
            tf.Tensor([8 9], shape=(2,), dtype=int32)                 
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 13-1. Chaining dataset transformations               
                                                                      
          In this example, we first call the repeat() method on the original dataset, and it
          returns a new dataset that will repeat the items of the original dataset three times. Of
          course, this will not copy all the data in memory three times! (If you call this method
          with no arguments, the new dataset will repeat the source dataset forever, so the code
          that iterates over the dataset will have to decide when to stop.) Then we call the
          batch() method on this new dataset, and again this creates a new dataset. This one
          will group the items of the previous dataset in batches of seven items. Finally, we iter‐
          ate over the items of this final dataset. As you can see, the batch() method had to
          output a final batch of size two instead of seven, but you can call it with drop_remain
          der=True if you want it to drop this final batch so that all batches have the exact same
          size.
