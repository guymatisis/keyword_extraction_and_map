          parameters for the unregularized MSE are θ = 2 and θ = 0.5).

          The two bottom plots show the same thing but with an ℓ penalty instead. In the

          bottom-left plot, you can see that the ℓ loss decreases with the distance to the origin,

          so Gradient Descent just takes a straight path toward that point. In the bottom-right
          plot, the contours represent Ridge Regression’s cost function (i.e., an MSE cost func‐
          tion plus an ℓ loss). There are two main differences with Lasso. First, the gradients

          get smaller as the parameters approach the global optimum, so Gradient Descent nat‐
          urally slows down, which helps convergence (as there is no bouncing around). Sec‐
          ond, the optimal parameters (represented by the red square) get closer and closer to
          the origin when you increase α, but they never get eliminated entirely.
                   To avoid Gradient Descent from bouncing around the optimum at
                   the end when using Lasso, you need to gradually reduce the learn‐
                   ing rate during training (it will still bounce around the optimum,
                   but the steps will get smaller and smaller, so it will converge).
