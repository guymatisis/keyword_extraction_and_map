parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transformation generally
imputer
relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for an . All transform‐
ers also have a convenience method called fit_transform() that is equiva‐
lent to calling fit() and then transform() (but sometimes
fit_transform() is optimized and runs much faster).
<i>Predictors</i>
Finally, some estimators, given a dataset, are capable of making predictions;
LinearRegression
they are called <i>predictors.</i> For example, the model in the
previous chapter was a predictor: given a country’s GDP per capita, it pre‐
dicted life satisfaction. A predictor has a predict() method that takes a
dataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions.
It also has a score() method that measures the quality of the predictions,
given a test set (and the corresponding labels, in the case of supervised learn‐
ing algorithms).18
<i>Inspection</i>
All the estimator’s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public instance
imputer.strategy
variables (e.g., ), and all the estimator’s learned parameters are
accessible via public instance variables with an underscore suffix (e.g.,
imputer.statistics_).
<i>Nonproliferation</i> <i>of</i> <i>classes</i>
Datasets are represented as NumPy arrays or SciPy sparse matrices, instead of
homemade classes. Hyperparameters are just regular Python strings or numbers.
<i>Composition</i>
Existing building blocks are reused as much as possible. For example, it is easy to
Pipeline
create a estimator from an arbitrary sequence of transformers followed
by a final estimator, as we will see.
<i>Sensible</i> <i>defaults</i>
Scikit-Learn provides reasonable default values for most parameters, making it
easy to quickly create a baseline working system.

So far we have only dealt with numerical attributes, but now let’s look at text
attributes. In this dataset, there is just one: the ocean_proximity attribute. Let’s look
at its value for the first 10 instances:
