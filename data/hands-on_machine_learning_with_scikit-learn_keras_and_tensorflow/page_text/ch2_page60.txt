                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          other numerical attribute. Since there are now 11 numerical attributes, you would get
          112 = 121 plots, which would not fit on a page—so let’s just focus on a few promising
          attributes that seem most correlated with the median housing value (Figure 2-15):
                                                                      
            from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix                
            attributes = ["median_house_value", "median_income", "total_rooms",
                    "housing_median_age"]                             
            scatter_matrix(housing[attributes], figsize=(12, 8))      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 2-15. This scatter matrix plots every numerical attribute against every other
          numerical attribute, plus a histogram of each numerical attribute
                                                                      
          The main diagonal (top left to bottom right) would be full of straight lines if pandas
          plotted each variable against itself, which would not be very useful. So instead pandas
          displays a histogram of each attribute (other options are available; see the pandas
          documentation for more details).                            
          The most promising attribute to predict the median house value is the median
          income, so let’s zoom in on their correlation scatterplot (Figure 2-16):
            housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="median_income", y="median_house_value",
                    alpha=0.1)
