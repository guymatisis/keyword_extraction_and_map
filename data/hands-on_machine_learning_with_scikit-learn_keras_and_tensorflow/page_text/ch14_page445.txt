Although IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat the chess world champion Garry Kas‐
parov back in 1996, it wasn’t until fairly recently that computers were able to reliably
perform seemingly trivial tasks such as detecting a puppy in a picture or recognizing
spoken words. Why are these tasks so effortless to us humans? The answer lies in the
fact that perception largely takes place outside the realm of our consciousness, within
specialized visual, auditory, and other sensory modules in our brains. By the time
sensory information reaches our consciousness, it is already adorned with high-level
features; for example, when you look at a picture of a cute puppy, you cannot choose
<i>not</i> to see the puppy, <i>not</i> to notice its cuteness. Nor can you explain <i>how</i> you recog‐
nize a cute puppy; it’s just obvious to you. Thus, we cannot trust our subjective expe‐
rience: perception is not trivial at all, and to understand it we must look at how the
sensory modules work.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) emerged from the study of the brain’s visual
cortex, and they have been used in image recognition since the 1980s. In the last few
years, thanks to the increase in computational power, the amount of available training
data, and the tricks presented in Chapter 11 for training deep nets, CNNs have man‐
aged to achieve superhuman performance on some complex visual tasks. They power
image search services, self-driving cars, automatic video classification systems, and
more. Moreover, CNNs are not restricted to visual perception: they are also successful
at many other tasks, such as voice recognition and natural language processing. How‐
ever, we will focus on visual applications for now.
In this chapter we will explore where CNNs came from, what their building blocks
look like, and how to implement them using TensorFlow and Keras. Then we will dis‐
cuss some of the best CNN architectures, as well as other visual tasks, including
