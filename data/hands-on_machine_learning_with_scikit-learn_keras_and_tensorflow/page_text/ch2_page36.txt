In this chapter we’ll use the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repos‐
itory2
(see Figure 2-1). This dataset is based on data from the 1990 California census.
It is not exactly recent (a nice house in the Bay Area was still affordable at the time),
but it has many qualities for learning, so we will pretend it is recent data. For teaching
purposes I’ve added a categorical attribute and removed a few features.
