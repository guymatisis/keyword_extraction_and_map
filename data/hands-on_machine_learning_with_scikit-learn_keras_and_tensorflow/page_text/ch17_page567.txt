Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning dense representations
of the input data, called <i>latent</i> <i>representations</i> or <i>codings,</i> without any supervision (i.e.,
the training set is unlabeled). These codings typically have a much lower dimension‐
ality than the input data, making autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction
(see Chapter 8), especially for visualization purposes. Autoencoders also act as feature
detectors, and they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks
(as we discussed in Chapter 11). Lastly, some autoencoders are <i>generative</i> <i>models:</i> they
are capable of randomly generating new data that looks very similar to the training
data. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of faces, and it would
then be able to generate new faces. However, the generated images are usually fuzzy
and not entirely realistic.
In contrast, faces generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs) are now so
convincing that it is hard to believe that the people they represent do not exist. You
can judge so for yourself by visiting <i>https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/,</i> a website that
shows faces generated by a recent GAN architecture called <i>StyleGAN</i> (you can also
check out <i>https://thisrentaldoesnotexist.com/</i> to see some generated Airbnb bed‐
rooms). GANs are now widely used for super resolution (increasing the resolution of
an image), colorization, powerful image editing (e.g., replacing photo bombers with
realistic background), turning a simple sketch into a photorealistic image, predicting
the next frames in a video, augmenting a dataset (to train other models), generating
other types of data (such as text, audio, and time series), identifying the weaknesses in
other models and strengthening them, and more.
