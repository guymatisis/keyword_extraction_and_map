                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
            fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist              
            (X_train_full, y_train_full), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
          When loading MNIST or Fashion MNIST using Keras rather than Scikit-Learn, one
          important difference is that every image is represented as a 28 × 28 array rather than
          a 1D array of size 784. Moreover, the pixel intensities are represented as integers
          (from 0 to 255) rather than floats (from 0.0 to 255.0). Let’s take a look at the shape
          and data type of the training set:                          
                                                                      
            >>> X_train_full.shape                                    
            (60000, 28, 28)                                           
            >>> X_train_full.dtype                                    
            dtype('uint8')                                            
          Note that the dataset is already split into a training set and a test set, but there is no
          validation set, so we’ll create one now. Additionally, since we are going to train the
          neural network using Gradient Descent, we must scale the input features. For simplic‐
          ity, we’ll scale the pixel intensities down to the 0–1 range by dividing them by 255.0
          (this also converts them to floats):                        
            X_valid, X_train = X_train_full[:5000] / 255.0, X_train_full[5000:] / 255.0
            y_valid, y_train = y_train_full[:5000], y_train_full[5000:]
          With MNIST, when the label is equal to 5, it means that the image represents the
          handwritten digit 5. Easy. For Fashion MNIST, however, we need the list of class
          names to know what we are dealing with:                     
            class_names = ["T-shirt/top", "Trouser", "Pullover", "Dress", "Coat",
                     "Sandal", "Shirt", "Sneaker", "Bag", "Ankle boot"]
          For example, the first image in the training set represents a coat:
            >>> class_names[y_train[0]]                               
            'Coat'                                                    
          Figure 10-11 shows some samples from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
