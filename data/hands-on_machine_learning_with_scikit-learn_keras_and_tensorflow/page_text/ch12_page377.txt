                   Flow API, but it’s impossible to cover them all, so you should really
                   take some time to browse through the API; you will find that it is
                   quite rich and well documented.

          At the lowest level, each TensorFlow operation (op for short) is implemented using
          highly efficient C++ code.2 Many operations have multiple implementations called
          kernels: each kernel is dedicated to a specific device type, such as CPUs, GPUs, or
          even TPUs (tensor processing units). As you may know, GPUs can dramatically speed
          up computations by splitting them into many smaller chunks and running them in
          parallel across many GPU threads. TPUs are even faster: they are custom ASIC chips
          built specifically for Deep Learning operations3 (we will discuss how to use Tensor‐
          Flow with GPUs or TPUs in Chapter 19).                      
          TensorFlow’s architecture is shown in Figure 12-2. Most of the time your code will
          use the high-level APIs (especially tf.keras and tf.data); but when you need more flex‐
          ibility, you will use the lower-level Python API, handling tensors directly. Note that
                                                                      
                                                                      
          2 If you ever need to (but you probably won’t), you can write your own operations using the C++ API.
