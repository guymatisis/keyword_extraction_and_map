This plot reveals a few things. First, the correlation is indeed very strong; you can
clearly see the upward trend, and the points are not too dispersed. Second, the price
cap that we noticed earlier is clearly visible as a horizontal line at $500,000. But this
plot reveals other less obvious straight lines: a horizontal line around $450,000,
another around $350,000, perhaps one around $280,000, and a few more below that.
You may want to try removing the corresponding districts to prevent your algorithms
from learning to reproduce these data quirks.

Hopefully the previous sections gave you an idea of a few ways you can explore the
data and gain insights. You identified a few data quirks that you may want to clean up
before feeding the data to a Machine Learning algorithm, and you found interesting
correlations between attributes, in particular with the target attribute. You also
noticed that some attributes have a tail-heavy distribution, so you may want to trans‐
form them (e.g., by computing their logarithm). Of course, your mileage will vary
considerably with each project, but the general ideas are similar.
One last thing you may want to do before preparing the data for Machine Learning
algorithms is to try out various attribute combinations. For example, the total num‐
ber of rooms in a district is not very useful if you don’t know how many households
there are. What you really want is the number of rooms per household. Similarly, the
total number of bedrooms by itself is not very useful: you probably want to compare
it to the number of rooms. And the population per household also seems like an
interesting attribute combination to look at. Let’s create these new attributes:
