When Alan Turing imagined his famous Turing test1 in 1950, his objective was to
evaluate a machine’s ability to match human intelligence. He could have tested for
many things, such as the ability to recognize cats in pictures, play chess, compose
music, or escape a maze, but, interestingly, he chose a linguistic task. More specifi‐
cally, he devised a <i>chatbot</i> capable of fooling its interlocutor into thinking it was
human. 2 This test does have its weaknesses: a set of hardcoded rules can fool unsus‐
pecting or naive humans (e.g., the machine could give vague predefined answers in
response to some keywords; it could pretend that it is joking or drunk, to get a pass
on its weirdest answers; or it could escape difficult questions by answering them with
its own questions), and many aspects of human intelligence are utterly ignored (e.g.,
the ability to interpret nonverbal communication such as facial expressions, or to
learn a manual task). But the test does highlight the fact that mastering language is
arguably <i>Homo</i> <i>sapiens’s</i> greatest cognitive ability. Can we build a machine that can
read and write natural language?
A common approach for natural language tasks is to use recurrent neural networks.
We will therefore continue to explore RNNs (introduced in Chapter 15), starting with
a <i>character</i> <i>RNN,</i> trained to predict the next character in a sentence. This will allow us
to generate some original text, and in the process we will see how to build a Tensor‐
Flow Dataset on a very long sequence. We will first use a <i>stateless</i> <i>RNN</i> (which learns
