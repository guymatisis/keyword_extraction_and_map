          Logical Computations with Neurons                           
          McCulloch and Pitts proposed a very simple model of the biological neuron, which
          later became known as an artificial neuron: it has one or more binary (on/off) inputs
          and one binary output. The artificial neuron activates its output when more than a
          certain number of its inputs are active. In their paper, they showed that even with
          such a simplified model it is possible to build a network of artificial neurons that
          computes any logical proposition you want. To see how such a network works, letâ€™s
          build a few ANNs that perform various logical computations (see Figure 10-3),
          assuming that a neuron is activated when at least two of its inputs are active.
