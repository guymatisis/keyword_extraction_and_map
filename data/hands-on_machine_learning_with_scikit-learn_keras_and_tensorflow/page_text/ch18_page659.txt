<i>Figure</i> <i>18-15.</i> <i>Two</i> <i>trajectories</i> <i>containing</i> <i>three</i> <i>consecutive</i> <i>steps</i> <i>each</i>
Each trajectory is a concise representation of a sequence of consecutive time steps
and action steps, designed to avoid redundancy. How so? Well, as you can see in
Figure 18-16, transition <i>n</i> is composed of time step <i>n,</i> action step <i>n,</i> and time step <i>n</i> +
1, while transition <i>n</i> + 1 is composed of time step <i>n</i> + 1, action step <i>n</i> + 1, and time
step <i>n</i> + 2. If we just stored these two transitions directly in the replay buffer, the time
step <i>n</i> + 1 would be duplicated. To avoid this duplication, the <i>nth</i> trajectory step
includes only the type and observation from time step <i>n</i> (not its reward and dis‐
count), and it does not contain the observation from time step <i>n</i> + 1 (however, it does
contain a copy of the next time step’s type; that’s the only duplication).
