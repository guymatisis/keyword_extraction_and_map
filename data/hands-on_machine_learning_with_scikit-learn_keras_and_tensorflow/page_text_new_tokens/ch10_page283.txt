McCulloch and Pitts proposed a very simple model of the biological neuron, which
later became known as an <i>artificial</i> <i>neuron:</i> it has one or more binary (on/off) inputs
and one binary output. The artificial neuron activates its output when more than a
certain number of its inputs are active. In their paper, they showed that even with
such a simplified model it is possible to build a network of artificial neurons that
computes any logical proposition you want. To see how such a network works, letâ€™s
build a few ANNs that perform various logical computations (see Figure 10-3),
assuming that a neuron is activated when at least two of its inputs are active.
