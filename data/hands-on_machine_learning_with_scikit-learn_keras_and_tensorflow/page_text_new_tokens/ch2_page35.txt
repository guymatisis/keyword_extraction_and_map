In this chapter you will work through an example project end to end, pretending to
be a recently hired data scientist at a real estate company. 1 Here are the main steps
you will go through:
1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
