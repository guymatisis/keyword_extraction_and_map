The first step is to get your hands on a GPU. There are two options for this: you can
either purchase your own GPU(s), or you can use GPU-equipped virtual machines
on the cloud. Let’s start with the first option.

If you choose to purchase a GPU card, then take some time to make the right choice.
Tim Dettmers wrote an excellent blog post to help you choose, and he updates it reg‐
ularly: I encourage you to read it carefully. At the time of this writing, TensorFlow
only supports Nvidia cards with CUDA Compute Capability 3.5+ (as well as Google’s
TPUs, of course), but it may extend its support to other manufacturers. Moreover,
although TPUs are currently only available on GCP, it is highly likely that TPU-like
cards will be available for sale in the near future, and TensorFlow may support them.
In short, make sure to check TensorFlow’s documentation to see what devices are
supported at this point.
If you go for an Nvidia GPU card, you will need to install the appropriate Nvidia
drivers and several Nvidia libraries.10 These include the <i>Compute</i> <i>Unified</i> <i>Device</i>
<i>Architecture</i> library (CUDA), which allows developers to use CUDA-enabled GPUs
for all sorts of computations (not just graphics acceleration), and the <i>CUDA</i> <i>Deep</i>
<i>Neural</i> <i>Network</i> library (cuDNN), a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for DNNs.
cuDNN provides optimized implementations of common DNN computations such
as activation layers, normalization, forward and backward convolutions, and pooling
(see Chapter 14). It is part of Nvidia’s Deep Learning SDK (note that you’ll need to
create an Nvidia developer account in order to download it). TensorFlow uses CUDA
and cuDNN to control the GPU cards and accelerate computations (see
Figure 19-10).
