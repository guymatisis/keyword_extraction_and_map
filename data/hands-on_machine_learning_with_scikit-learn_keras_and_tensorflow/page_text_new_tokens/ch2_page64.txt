imputer fit()
Now you can fit the instance to the training data using the method:
imputer.fit(housing_num)
imputer
The has simply computed the median of each attribute and stored the result
in its statistics_ instance variable. Only the total_bedrooms attribute had missing
values, but we cannot be sure that there won’t be any missing values in new data after
imputer
the system goes live, so it is safer to apply the to all the numerical attributes:
<b>>>></b> imputer.statistics_
array([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])
<b>>>></b> housing_num.median().values
array([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])
imputer
Now you can use this “trained” to transform the training set by replacing
missing values with the learned medians:
X = imputer.transform(housing_num)
The result is a plain NumPy array containing the transformed features. If you want to
put it back into a pandas DataFrame, it’s simple:
housing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns,
index=housing_num.index)

Scikit-Learn’s API is remarkably well designed. These are the main design principles: 17
<i>Consistency</i>
All objects share a consistent and simple interface:
<i>Estimators</i>
Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset is called an
imputer
<i>estimator</i> (e.g., an is an estimator). The estimation itself is per‐
fit()
formed by the method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or
two for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the
labels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is con‐
sidered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer ’s strategy ), and it must be
set as an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).
<i>Transformers</i>
imputer)
Some estimators (such as an can also transform a dataset; these are
called <i>transformers.</i> Once again, the API is simple: the transformation is

performed by the method with the dataset to transform as a
