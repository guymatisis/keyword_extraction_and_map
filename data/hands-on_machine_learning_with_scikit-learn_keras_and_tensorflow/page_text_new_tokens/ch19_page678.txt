3. If you have used GCP before and your free trial has expired, then the services you
will use in this chapter will cost you some money. It should not be too much,
especially if you remember to turn off the services when you do not need them
anymore. Make sure you understand and agree to the pricing conditions before
you run any service. I hereby decline any responsibility if services end up costing
more than you expected! Also make sure your billing account is active. To check,
open the navigation menu on the left and click Billing, and make sure you have
set up a payment method and that the billing account is active.
4. Every resource in GCP belongs to a project. This includes all the virtual
machines you may use, the files you store, and the training jobs you run. When
you create an account, GCP automatically creates a project for you, called “My
First Project.” If you want, you can change its display name by going to the
project settings: in the navigation menu (on the left of the screen), select IAM &
admin → Settings, change the project’s display name, and click Save. Note that
the project also has a unique ID and number. You can choose the project ID
when you create a project, but you cannot change it later. The project number is
automatically generated and cannot be changed. If you want to create a new
project, click the project name at the top of the page, then click New Project and
enter the project ID. Make sure billing is active for this new project.
