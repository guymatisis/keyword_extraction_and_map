However, projection is not always the best approach to dimensionality reduction. In
many cases the subspace may twist and turn, such as in the famous <i>Swiss</i> <i>roll</i> toy data‚Äê
set represented in Figure 8-4.

Simply projecting onto a plane (e.g., by dropping <i>x</i> ) would squash different layers of
3
the Swiss roll together, as shown on the left side of Figure 8-5. What you really want is
to unroll the Swiss roll to obtain the 2D dataset on the right side of Figure 8-5.
