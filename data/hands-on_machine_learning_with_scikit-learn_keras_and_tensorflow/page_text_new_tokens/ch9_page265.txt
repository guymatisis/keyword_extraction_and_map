"spherical"
All clusters must be spherical, but they can have different diameters (i.e., differ‐
ent variances).
"diag"
Clusters can take on any ellipsoidal shape of any size, but the ellipsoid’s axes must
be parallel to the coordinate axes (i.e., the covariance matrices must be diagonal).
"tied"
All clusters must have the same ellipsoidal shape, size, and orientation (i.e., all
clusters share the same covariance matrix).
covariance_type "full"
By default, is equal to , which means that each cluster can
take on any shape, size, and orientation (it has its own unconstrained covariance
cova
matrix). Figure 9-18 plots the solutions found by the EM algorithm when
riance_type "tied" "spherical.”

The computational complexity of training a GaussianMixture
model depends on the number of instances <i>m,</i> the number of
dimensions <i>n,</i> the number of clusters <i>k,</i> and the constraints on the

covariance matrices. If is or ,

it is <i>O(kmn),</i> assuming the data has a clustering structure. If

scale to large numbers of features.
Gaussian mixture models can also be used for anomaly detection. Let’s see how.
