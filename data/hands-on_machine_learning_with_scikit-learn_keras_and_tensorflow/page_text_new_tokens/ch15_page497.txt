The batter hits the ball. The outfielder immediately starts running, anticipating the
ball’s trajectory. He tracks it, adapts his movements, and finally catches it (under a
thunder of applause). Predicting the future is something you do all the time, whether
you are finishing a friend’s sentence or anticipating the smell of coffee at breakfast. In
this chapter we will discuss recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a class of nets that can
predict the future (well, up to a point, of course). They can analyze time series data
such as stock prices, and tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems,
they can anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally, they can
work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on fixed-sized inputs like all the
nets we have considered so far. For example, they can take sentences, documents, or
audio samples as input, making them extremely useful for natural language process‐
ing applications such as automatic translation or speech-to-text.
In this chapter we will first look at the fundamental concepts underlying RNNs and
how to train them using backpropagation through time, then we will use them to
forecast a time series. After that we’ll explore the two main difficulties that RNNs
face:
• Unstable gradients (discussed in Chapter 11), which can be alleviated using vari‐
ous techniques, including recurrent dropout and recurrent layer normalization
• A (very) limited short-term memory, which can be extended using LSTM and
GRU cells
RNNs are not the only types of neural networks capable of handling sequential data:
for small sequences, a regular dense network can do the trick; and for very long
sequences, such as audio samples or text, convolutional neural networks can actually
