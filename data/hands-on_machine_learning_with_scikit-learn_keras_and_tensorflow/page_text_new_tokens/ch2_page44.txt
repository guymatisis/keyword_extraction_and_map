$ <b>cd</b> <b>$ML_PATH</b>
$ <b>source</b> <b>my_env/bin/activate</b> # on Linux or macOS
$ <b>.\my_env\Scripts\activate</b> # on Windows
To deactivate this environment, type <b>deactivate</b> . While the environment is active,
any package you install using pip will be installed in this isolated environment, and
Python will only have access to these packages (if you also want access to the system’s
packages, you should create the environment using virtualenv’s --system-site-
packages
option). Check out virtualenv’s documentation for more information.
Now you can install all the required modules and their dependencies using this sim‐
ple pip command (if you are not using a virtualenv, you will need the --user option
or administrator rights):
$ <b>python3</b> <b>-m</b> <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>-U</b> <b>jupyter</b> <b>matplotlib</b> <b>numpy</b> <b>pandas</b> <b>scipy</b> <b>scikit-learn</b>
Collecting jupyter

Collecting matplotlib
[...]
If you created a virtualenv, you need to register it to Jupyter and give it a name:
$ <b>python3</b> <b>-m</b> <b>ipykernel</b> <b>install</b> <b>--user</b> <b>--name=python3</b>
Now you can fire up Jupyter by typing the following command:
$ <b>jupyter</b> <b>notebook</b>
[...] Serving notebooks from local directory: [...]/ml
[...] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[...] http://localhost:8888/?token=60995e108e44ac8d8865a[...]
[...] or http://127.0.0.1:8889/?token=60995e108e44ac8d8865a[...]
[...] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels [...]
A Jupyter server is now running in your terminal, listening to port 8888. You can visit
this server by opening your web browser to <i>http://localhost:8888/</i> (this usually hap‐
pens automatically when the server starts). You should see your empty workspace
directory (containing only the <i>env</i> directory if you followed the preceding virtualenv
instructions).
Now create a new Python notebook by clicking the New button and selecting the
appropriate Python version 9 (see Figure 2-3). Doing that will create a new notebook
file called <i>Untitled.ipynb</i> in your workspace, start a Jupyter Python kernel to run the
notebook, and open this notebook in a new tab. You should start by renaming this
notebook to “Housing” (this will automatically rename the file to <i>Housing.ipynb)</i> by
clicking Untitled and typing the new name.
