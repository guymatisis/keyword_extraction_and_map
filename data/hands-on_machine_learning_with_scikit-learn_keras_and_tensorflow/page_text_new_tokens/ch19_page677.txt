chase, maintain, and upgrade all the hardware infrastructure, you will want to use
virtual machines on a cloud platform such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google
Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, or some other Platform-
as-a-Service (PaaS). Managing all the virtual machines, handling container orchestra‐
tion (even with the help of Kubernetes), taking care of TF Serving configuration,
tuning and monitoring—all of this can be a full-time job. Fortunately, some service
providers can take care of all this for you. In this chapter we will use Google Cloud AI
Platform because it’s the only platform with TPUs today, it supports TensorFlow 2, it
offers a nice suite of AI services (e.g., AutoML, Vision API, Natural Language API),
and it is the one I have the most experience with. But there are several other provid‐
ers in this space, such as Amazon AWS SageMaker and Microsoft AI Platform, which
are also capable of serving TensorFlow models.

Now let’s see how to serve our wonderful MNIST model on the cloud!

Before you can deploy a model, there’s a little bit of setup to take care of:
1. Log in to your Google account, and then go to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
console (see Figure 19-3). If you don’t have a Google account, you’ll have to cre‐
ate one.
2. If it is your first time using GCP, you will have to read and accept the terms and
conditions. Click Tour Console if you want. At the time of this writing, new users
are offered a free trial, including $300 worth of GCP credit that you can use over
the course of 12 months. You will only need a small portion of that to pay for the
services you will use in this chapter. Upon signing up for the free trial, you will
still need to create a payment profile and enter your credit card number: it is used
for verification purposes (probably to avoid people using the free trial multiple
times), but you will not be billed. Activate and upgrade your account if requested.
