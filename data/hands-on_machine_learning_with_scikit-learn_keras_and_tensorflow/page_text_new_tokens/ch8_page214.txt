set on a graph and often gain some important insights by visually detecting patterns,
such as clusters. Moreover, DataViz is essential to communicate your conclusions to
people who are not data scientists—in particular, decision makers who will use your
results.
In this chapter we will discuss the curse of dimensionality and get a sense of what
goes on in high-dimensional space. Then, we will consider the two main approaches
to dimensionality reduction (projection and Manifold Learning), and we will go
through three of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, Kernel
PCA, and LLE.

We are so used to living in three dimensions1 that our intuition fails us when we try
to imagine a high-dimensional space. Even a basic 4D hypercube is incredibly hard to
picture in our minds (see Figure 8-1), let alone a 200-dimensional ellipsoid bent in a
1,000-dimensional space.

It turns out that many things behave very differently in high-dimensional space. For
example, if you pick a random point in a unit square (a 1 × 1 square), it will have only
about a 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words, it
is very unlikely that a random point will be “extreme” along any dimension). But in a
10,000-dimensional unit hypercube, this probability is greater than 99.999999%. Most
points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very close to the border.3
