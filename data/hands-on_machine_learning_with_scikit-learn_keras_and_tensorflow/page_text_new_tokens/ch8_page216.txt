Notice that all training instances lie close to a plane: this is a lower-dimensional (2D)
subspace of the high-dimensional (3D) space. If we project every training instance
perpendicularly onto this subspace (as represented by the short lines connecting the
instances to the plane), we get the new 2D dataset shown in Figure 8-3. Ta-da! We
have just reduced the dataset’s dimensionality from 3D to 2D. Note that the axes cor‐
respond to new features <i>z</i> and <i>z</i> (the coordinates of the projections on the plane).
