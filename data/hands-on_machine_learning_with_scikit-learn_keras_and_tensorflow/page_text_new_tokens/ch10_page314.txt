This example looks very much like the Functional API, except we do not need to cre‐
ate the inputs; we just use the input argument to the call() method, and we separate
the creation of the layers21 in the constructor from their usage in the call() method.
call()
The big difference is that you can do pretty much anything you want in the
method: for loops, if statements, low-level TensorFlow operations—your imagina‐
tion is the limit (see Chapter 12)! This makes it a great API for researchers experi‐
menting with new ideas.
This extra flexibility does come at a cost: your model’s architecture is hidden within
the call() method, so Keras cannot easily inspect it; it cannot save or clone it; and
summary()
when you call the method, you only get a list of layers, without any infor‐
mation on how they are connected to each other. Moreover, Keras cannot check types
and shapes ahead of time, and it is easier to make mistakes. So unless you really need
that extra flexibility, you should probably stick to the Sequential API or the Func‐
tional API.
Keras models can be used just like regular layers, so you can easily
combine them to build complex architectures.
Now that you know how to build and train neural nets using Keras, you will want to
save them!

When using the Sequential API or the Functional API, saving a trained Keras model
is as simple as it gets:
model = keras.models.Sequential([...]) <i>#</i> <i>or</i> <i>keras.Model([...])</i>
model.compile([...])
model.fit([...])
model.save("my_keras_model.h5")
Keras will use the HDF5 format to save both the model’s architecture (including every
layer’s hyperparameters) and the values of all the model parameters for every layer
(e.g., connection weights and biases). It also saves the optimizer (including its hyper‐
parameters and any state it may have). In Chapter 19, we will see how to save a
tf.keras model using TensorFlow’s SavedModel format instead.
