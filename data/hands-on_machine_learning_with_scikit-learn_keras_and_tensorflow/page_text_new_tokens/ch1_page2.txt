If you already know all the Machine Learning basics, you may want
to skip directly to Chapter 2. If you are not sure, try to answer all
the questions listed at the end of the chapter before moving on.

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can
<i>learn</i> <i>from</i> <i>data.</i>
Here is a slightly more general definition:
[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.
—Arthur Samuel, 1959
And a more engineering-oriented one:
A computer program is said to learn from experience <i>E</i> with respect to some task <i>T</i>
and some performance measure <i>P,</i> if its performance on <i>T,</i> as measured by <i>P,</i>
improves with experience <i>E.</i>
—Tom Mitchell, 1997
Your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that, given examples of spam emails
(e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called “ham”) emails,
can learn to flag spam. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the <i>train‐</i>
<i>ing</i> <i>set.</i> Each training example is called a <i>training</i> <i>instance</i> (or <i>sample).</i> In this case, the
task <i>T</i> is to flag spam for new emails, the experience <i>E</i> is the <i>training</i> <i>data,</i> and the
performance measure <i>P</i> needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of
correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called <i>accuracy,</i>
and it is often used in classification tasks.
If you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is
not suddenly better at any task. Thus, downloading a copy of Wikipedia is not
Machine Learning.

Consider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techni‐
ques (Figure 1-1):
1. First you would consider what spam typically looks like. You might notice that
some words or phrases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to
come up a lot in the subject line. Perhaps you would also notice a few other pat‐
terns in the sender’s name, the email’s body, and other parts of the email.
