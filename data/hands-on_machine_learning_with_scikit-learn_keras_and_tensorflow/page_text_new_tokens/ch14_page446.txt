object detection (classifying multiple objects in an image and placing bounding boxes
around them) and semantic segmentation (classifying each pixel according to the
class of the object it belongs to).

David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel performed a series of experiments on cats in
19581 and 19592 (and a few years later on monkeys3), giving crucial insights into the
structure of the visual cortex (the authors received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine in 1981 for their work). In particular, they showed that many neurons in
the visual cortex have a small <i>local</i> <i>receptive</i> <i>field,</i> meaning they react only to visual
stimuli located in a limited region of the visual field (see Figure 14-1, in which the
local receptive fields of five neurons are represented by dashed circles). The receptive
fields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual field.
Moreover, the authors showed that some neurons react only to images of horizontal
lines, while others react only to lines with different orientations (two neurons may
have the same receptive field but react to different line orientations). They also
noticed that some neurons have larger receptive fields, and they react to more com‐
plex patterns that are combinations of the lower-level patterns. These observations
led to the idea that the higher-level neurons are based on the outputs of neighboring
lower-level neurons (in Figure 14-1, notice that each neuron is connected only to a
few neurons from the previous layer). This powerful architecture is able to detect all
sorts of complex patterns in any area of the visual field.
