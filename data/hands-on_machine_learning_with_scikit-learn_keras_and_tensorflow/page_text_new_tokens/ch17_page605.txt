subtracting the feature map’s mean and dividing by its standard deviation), then
it uses the style vector to determine the scale and offset of each feature map (the
style vector contains one scale and one bias term for each feature map).

The idea of adding noise independently from the codings is very important. Some
parts of an image are quite random, such as the exact position of each freckle or hair.
In earlier GANs, this randomness had to either come from the codings or be some
pseudorandom noise produced by the generator itself. If it came from the codings, it
meant that the generator had to dedicate a significant portion of the codings’ repre‐
sentational power to store noise: this is quite wasteful. Moreover, the noise had to be
