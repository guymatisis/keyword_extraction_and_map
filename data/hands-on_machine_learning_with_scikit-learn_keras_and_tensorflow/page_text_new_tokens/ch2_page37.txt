Welcome to the Machine Learning Housing Corporation! Your first task is to use Cal‐
ifornia census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes
metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each
block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which
the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a popula‐
tion of 600 to 3,000 people). We will call them “districts” for short.
Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing
price in any district, given all the other metrics.
Since you are a well-organized data scientist, the first thing you
should do is pull out your Machine Learning project checklist. You
can start with the one in Appendix B; it should work reasonably
well for most Machine Learning projects, but make sure to adapt it
to your needs. In this chapter we will go through many checklist
items, but we will also skip a few, either because they are self-
explanatory or because they will be discussed in later chapters.

The first question to ask your boss is what exactly the business objective is. Building a
model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit
from this model? Knowing the objective is important because it will determine how
you frame the problem, which algorithms you will select, which performance meas‐
ure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you will spend tweak‐
ing it.
Your boss answers that your model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median hous‐
ing price) will be fed to another Machine Learning system (see Figure 2-2), along
with many other signals.3 This downstream system will determine whether it is worth
investing in a given area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects
revenue.
