The correlation coefficient ranges from –1 to 1. When it is close to 1, it means that
there is a strong positive correlation; for example, the median house value tends to go
up when the median income goes up. When the coefficient is close to –1, it means
that there is a strong negative correlation; you can see a small negative correlation
between the latitude and the median house value (i.e., prices have a slight tendency to
go down when you go north). Finally, coefficients close to 0 mean that there is no
linear correlation. Figure 2-14 shows various plots along with the correlation coeffi‐
cient between their horizontal and vertical axes.

The correlation coefficient only measures linear correlations (“if <i>x</i>
goes up, then <i>y</i> generally goes up/down”). It may completely miss
out on nonlinear relationships (e.g., “if <i>x</i> is close to 0, then <i>y</i> gener‐
ally goes up”). Note how all the plots of the bottom row have a cor‐
relation coefficient equal to 0, despite the fact that their axes are
clearly not independent: these are examples of nonlinear relation‐
ships. Also, the second row shows examples where the correlation
coefficient is equal to 1 or –1; notice that this has nothing to do
with the slope. For example, your height in inches has a correlation
coefficient of 1 with your height in feet or in nanometers.
Another way to check for correlation between attributes is to use the pandas
scatter_matrix()
function, which plots every numerical attribute against every
