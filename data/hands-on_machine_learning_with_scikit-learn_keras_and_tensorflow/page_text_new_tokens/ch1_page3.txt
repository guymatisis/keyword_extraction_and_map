2. You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed,
and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns were
detected.
3. You would test your program and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it was good enough
to launch.

Since the problem is difficult, your program will likely become a long list of complex
rules—pretty hard to maintain.
In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically learns
which words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually fre‐
quent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples
(Figure 1-2). The program is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more
accurate.
What if spammers notice that all their emails containing “4U” are blocked? They
might start writing “For U” instead. A spam filter using traditional programming
techniques would need to be updated to flag “For U” emails. If spammers keep work‐
ing around your spam filter, you will need to keep writing new rules forever.
In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically noti‐
ces that “For U” has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts
flagging them without your intervention (Figure 1-3).
