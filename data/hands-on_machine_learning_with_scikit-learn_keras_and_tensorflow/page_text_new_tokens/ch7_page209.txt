To train the blender, a common approach is to use a hold-out set. 19 Let’s see how it
works. First, the training set is split into two subsets. The first subset is used to train
the predictors in the first layer (see Figure 7-13).

Next, the first layer’s predictors are used to make predictions on the second (held-
out) set (see Figure 7-14). This ensures that the predictions are “clean,” since the pre‐
dictors never saw these instances during training. For each instance in the hold-out
