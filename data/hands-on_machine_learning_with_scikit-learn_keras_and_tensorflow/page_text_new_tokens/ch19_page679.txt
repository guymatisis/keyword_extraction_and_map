Always set an alarm to remind yourself to turn services off
when you know you will only need them for a few hours, or
else you might leave them running for days or months, incur‐
ring potentially significant costs.
5. Now that you have a GCP account with billing activated, you can start using the
services. The first one you will need is Google Cloud Storage (GCS): this is where
you will put the SavedModels, the training data, and more. In the navigation
menu, scroll down to the Storage section, and click Storage → Browser. All your
files will go in one or more <i>buckets.</i> Click Create Bucket and choose the bucket
name (you may need to activate the Storage API first). GCS uses a single world‐
wide namespace for buckets, so simple names like “machine-learning” will most
likely not be available. Make sure the bucket name conforms to DNS naming
conventions, as it may be used in DNS records. Moreover, bucket names are pub‐
lic, so do not put anything private in there. It is common to use your domain
name or your company name as a prefix to ensure uniqueness, or simply use a
random number as part of the name. Choose the location where you want the
bucket to be hosted, and the rest of the options should be fine by default. Then
click Create.
6. Upload the <i>my_mnist_model</i> folder you created earlier (including one or more
versions) to your bucket. To do this, just go to the GCS Browser, click the bucket,
then drag and drop the <i>my_mnist_model</i> folder from your system to the bucket
(see Figure 19-4). Alternatively, you can click “Upload folder” and select the
<i>my_mnist_model</i> folder to upload. By default, the maximum size for a SavedMo‐
del is 250 MB, but it is possible to request a higher quota.
