The GRU cell is a simplified version of the LSTM cell, and it seems to perform just as
well12 (which explains its growing popularity). These are the main simplifications:
• Both state vectors are merged into a single vector <b>h</b> .
(t)
• A single gate controller <b>z</b> controls both the forget gate and the input gate. If the
(t)
gate controller outputs a 1, the forget gate is open (= 1) and the input gate is
closed (1 – 1 = 0). If it outputs a 0, the opposite happens. In other words, when‐
ever a memory must be stored, the location where it will be stored is erased first.
This is actually a frequent variant to the LSTM cell in and of itself.
• There is no output gate; the full state vector is output at every time step. How‐
ever, there is a new gate controller <b>r</b> that controls which part of the previous
(t)
state will be shown to the main layer (g ).
