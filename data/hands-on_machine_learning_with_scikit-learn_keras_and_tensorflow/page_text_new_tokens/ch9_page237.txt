Clustering is used in a wide variety of applications, including these:
<i>For</i> <i>customer</i> <i>segmentation</i>
You can cluster your customers based on their purchases and their activity on
your website. This is useful to understand who your customers are and what they
need, so you can adapt your products and marketing campaigns to each segment.
For example, customer segmentation can be useful in <i>recommender</i> <i>systems</i> to
suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.
<i>For</i> <i>data</i> <i>analysis</i>
When you analyze a new dataset, it can be helpful to run a clustering algorithm,
and then analyze each cluster separately.
<i>As</i> <i>a</i> <i>dimensionality</i> <i>reduction</i> <i>technique</i>
Once a dataset has been clustered, it is usually possible to measure each instance’s
<i>affinity</i> with each cluster (affinity is any measure of how well an instance fits into
a cluster). Each instance’s feature vector <b>x</b> can then be replaced with the vector of
its cluster affinities. If there are <i>k</i> clusters, then this vector is <i>k-dimensional.</i> This
vector is typically much lower-dimensional than the original feature vector, but it
can preserve enough information for further processing.
<i>For</i> <i>anomaly</i> <i>detection</i> <i>(also</i> <i>called</i> <i>outlier</i> <i>detection)</i>
Any instance that has a low affinity to all the clusters is likely to be an anomaly.
For example, if you have clustered the users of your website based on their
behavior, you can detect users with unusual behavior, such as an unusual number
of requests per second. Anomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting
defects in manufacturing, or for <i>fraud</i> <i>detection.</i>
<i>For</i> <i>semi-supervised</i> <i>learning</i>
If you only have a few labels, you could perform clustering and propagate the
labels to all the instances in the same cluster. This technique can greatly increase
