Once again, many GitHub repositories provide TensorFlow implementations of
semantic segmentation (TensorFlow 1 for now), and you will even find pretrained
<i>instance</i> <i>segmentation</i> models in the TensorFlow Models project. Instance segmenta‐
tion is similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of merging all objects of the
same class into one big lump, each object is distinguished from the others (e.g., it
identifies each individual bicycle). At present, the instance segmentation models
available in the TensorFlow Models project are based on the <i>Mask</i> <i>R-CNN</i> architec‐
ture, which was proposed in a 2017 paper:34 it extends the Faster R-CNN model by
additionally producing a pixel mask for each bounding box. So not only do you get a
bounding box around each object, with a set of estimated class probabilities, but you
also get a pixel mask that locates pixels in the bounding box that belong to the object.
As you can see, the field of Deep Computer Vision is vast and moving fast, with all
sorts of architectures popping out every year, all based on convolutional neural net‐
works. The progress made in just a few years has been astounding, and researchers
are now focusing on harder and harder problems, such as <i>adversarial</i> <i>learning</i> (which
attempts to make the network more resistant to images designed to fool it), explaina‐
bility (understanding why the network makes a specific classification), realistic <i>image</i>
<i>generation</i> (which we will come back to in Chapter 17), and <i>single-shot</i> <i>learning</i> (a sys‐
tem that can recognize an object after it has seen it just once). Some even explore
completely novel architectures, such as Geoffrey Hinton’s <i>capsule</i> <i>networks35</i> (I pre‐
sented them in a couple of videos, with the corresponding code in a notebook). Now
on to the next chapter, where we will look at how to process sequential data such as
time series using recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
