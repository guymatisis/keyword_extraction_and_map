This model has two <i>model</i> <i>parameters,</i> <i>θ</i> and <i>θ</i> By tweaking these parameters, you

can make your model represent any linear function, as shown in Figure 1-18.

Before you can use your model, you need to define the parameter values <i>θ</i> and <i>θ</i> .

How can you know which values will make your model perform best? To answer this
question, you need to specify a performance measure. You can either define a <i>utility</i>
<i>function</i> (or <i>fitness</i> <i>function)</i> that measures how <i>good</i> your model is, or you can define
a <i>cost</i> <i>function</i> that measures how <i>bad</i> it is. For Linear Regression problems, people
typically use a cost function that measures the distance between the linear model’s
predictions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.
This is where the Linear Regression algorithm comes in: you feed it your training
examples, and it finds the parameters that make the linear model fit best to your data.
This is called <i>training</i> the model. In our case, the algorithm finds that the optimal

parameter values are <i>θ</i> = 4.85 and <i>θ</i> = 4.91 × 10 .

Confusingly, the same word “model” can refer to a <i>type</i> <i>of</i> <i>model</i>
(e.g., Linear Regression), to a <i>fully</i> <i>specified</i> <i>model</i> <i>architecture</i> (e.g.,
Linear Regression with one input and one output), or to the <i>final</i>
<i>trained</i> <i>model</i> ready to be used for predictions (e.g., Linear Regres‐
sion with one input and one output, using <i>θ</i> = 4.85 and <i>θ</i> = 4.91 ×

10–5). Model selection consists in choosing the type of model and
fully specifying its architecture. Training a model means running
an algorithm to find the model parameters that will make it best fit
the training data (and hopefully make good predictions on new
data).
