What if you want to use your model in a website, running directly in the user’s
browser? This can be useful in many scenarios, such as:
• When your web application is often used in situations where the user’s connec‐
tivity is intermittent or slow (e.g., a website for hikers), so running the model
directly on the client side is the only way to make your website reliable.
• When you need the model’s responses to be as fast as possible (e.g., for an online
game). Removing the need to query the server to make predictions will definitely
reduce the latency and make the website much more responsive.
• When your web service makes predictions based on some private user data, and
you want to protect the user’s privacy by making the predictions on the client
side so that the private data never has to leave the user’s machine. 9
For all these scenarios, you can export your model to a special format that can be
loaded by the TensorFlow.js JavaScript library. This library can then use your model
to make predictions directly in the user’s browser. The TensorFlow.js project includes
tensorflowjs_converter
a tool that can convert a TensorFlow SavedModel or a
Keras model file to the <i>TensorFlow.js</i> <i>Layers</i> format: this is a directory containing a set
of sharded weight files in binary format and a <i>model.json</i> file that describes the mod‐
el’s architecture and links to the weight files. This format is optimized to be downloa‐
ded efficiently on the web. Users can then download the model and run predictions in
the browser using the TensorFlow.js library. Here is a code snippet to give you an idea
of what the JavaScript API looks like:
<b>import</b> * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
<b>const</b> model = await tf.loadLayersModel('https://example.com/tfjs/model.json');
<b>const</b> image = tf.fromPixels(webcamElement);
<b>const</b> prediction = model.predict(image);
Once again, doing justice to this topic would require a whole book. If you want to
learn more about TensorFlow.js, check out the O’Reilly book <i>Practical</i> <i>Deep</i> <i>Learning</i>
<i>for</i> <i>Cloud,</i> <i>Mobile,</i> <i>and</i> <i>Edge,</i> by Anirudh Koul, Siddha Ganju, and Meher Kasam.
Next, we will see how to use GPUs to speed up computations!
