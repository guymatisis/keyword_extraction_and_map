There are 20,640 instances in the dataset, which means that it is fairly small by
Machine Learning standards, but it’s perfect to get started. Notice that the total_bed
rooms
attribute has only 20,433 nonnull values, meaning that 207 districts are missing
this feature. We will need to take care of this later.
All attributes are numerical, except the ocean_proximity field. Its type is object, so it
could hold any kind of Python object. But since you loaded this data from a CSV file,
you know that it must be a text attribute. When you looked at the top five rows, you
probably noticed that the values in the ocean_proximity column were repetitive,
which means that it is probably a categorical attribute. You can find out what cate‐
gories exist and how many districts belong to each category by using the
value_counts()
method:
<b>>>></b> housing["ocean_proximity"].value_counts()
<1H OCEAN 9136
INLAND 6551
NEAR OCEAN 2658
NEAR BAY 2290
ISLAND 5
Name: ocean_proximity, dtype: int64
Let’s look at the other fields. The describe() method shows a summary of the
numerical attributes (Figure 2-7).
