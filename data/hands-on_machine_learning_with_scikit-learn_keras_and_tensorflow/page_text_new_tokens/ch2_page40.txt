This equation introduces several very common Machine Learning notations that we
will use throughout this book:
• <i>m</i> is the number of instances in the dataset you are measuring the RMSE on.
—For example, if you are evaluating the RMSE on a validation set of 2,000 dis‐
tricts, then <i>m</i> = 2,000.
• <b>x</b> (i) is a vector of all the feature values (excluding the label) of the <i>i</i> th instance in
the dataset, and <i>y</i> (i) is its label (the desired output value for that instance).
— For example, if the first district in the dataset is located at longitude –118.29°,
latitude 33.91°, and it has 1,416 inhabitants with a median income of $38,372,
and the median house value is $156,400 (ignoring the other features for now),
then:

<b>x</b> =

38,372
and:

<i>y</i> = 156,400
• <b>X</b> is a matrix containing all the feature values (excluding labels) of all instances in
the dataset. There is one row per instance, and the <i>i</i> th row is equal to the trans‐
⊺
pose of <b>x</b> (i) , noted (x (i) ) . 4
—For example, if the first district is as just described, then the matrix <b>X</b> looks
like this:
