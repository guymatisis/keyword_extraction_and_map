Now that’s much better: you can clearly see the high-density areas, namely the Bay
Area and around Los Angeles and San Diego, plus a long line of fairly high density in
the Central Valley, in particular around Sacramento and Fresno.
Our brains are very good at spotting patterns in pictures, but you may need to play
around with visualization parameters to make the patterns stand out.
Now let’s look at the housing prices (Figure 2-13). The radius of each circle represents
the district’s population (option s ), and the color represents the price (option c ). We
will use a predefined color map (option cmap ) called jet , which ranges from blue
prices):16
(low values) to red (high
housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", alpha=0.4,
s=housing["population"]/100, label="population", figsize=(10,7),
c="median_house_value", cmap=plt.get_cmap("jet"), colorbar=True,
)
plt.legend()
