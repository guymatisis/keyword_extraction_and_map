will likely be close to 1, and there will be few clusters. Finally, the Wishart distribution
is used to sample covariance matrices: the parameters d and V control the distribu‐
tion of cluster shapes.

Prior knowledge about the latent variables <b>z</b> can be encoded in a probability distribu‐
tion <i>p(z)</i> called the <i>prior.</i> For example, we may have a prior belief that the clusters are
likely to be few (low concentration), or conversely, that they are likely to be plentiful
(high concentration). This prior belief about the number of clusters can be adjusted
weight_concentration_prior
using the hyperparameter. Setting it to 0.01 or 10,000
gives very different clusterings (see Figure 9-23). The more data we have, however,
the less the priors matter. In fact, to plot diagrams with such large differences, you
must use very strong priors and little data.
