String()
are not TensorFlow operations (and neither are the other operations in this
code), so they cannot be included in a TensorFlow Function (except by wrapping
them in a tf.py_function() operation, which would make the code slower and less
portable, as we saw in Chapter 12). Fortunately, TensorFlow does include special pro‐
tobuf definitions for which it provides parsing operations.

The main protobuf typically used in a TFRecord file is the Example protobuf, which
represents one instance in a dataset. It contains a list of named features, where each
feature can either be a list of byte strings, a list of floats, or a list of integers. Here is
the protobuf definition:
syntax = "proto3";
message BytesList { repeated bytes value = 1; }
message FloatList { repeated <b>float</b> value = 1 [packed = <b>true];</b> }
message Int64List { repeated int64 value = 1 [packed = <b>true];</b> }
message Feature {
oneof kind {
BytesList bytes_list = 1;
FloatList float_list = 2;
Int64List int64_list = 3;
}
};
message Features { map<string, Feature> feature = 1; };
message Example { Features features = 1; };
The definitions of BytesList , FloatList , and Int64List are straightforward
[packed = true]
enough. Note that is used for repeated numerical fields, for a more
efficient encoding. A Feature contains either a BytesList , a FloatList , or an
Int64List. Features s)
A (with an contains a dictionary that maps a feature name to

the corresponding feature value. And finally, an contains only a
object. 8 Here is how you could create a tf.train.Example representing the same per‐
son as earlier and write it to a TFRecord file:
<b>from</b> <b>tensorflow.train</b> <b>import</b> BytesList, FloatList, Int64List
<b>from</b> <b>tensorflow.train</b> <b>import</b> Feature, Features, Example
person_example = Example(
features=Features(
feature={
"name": Feature(bytes_list=BytesList(value=[b"Alice"])),
