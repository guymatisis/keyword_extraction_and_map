7. Now you need to configure AI Platform (formerly known as ML Engine) so that
it knows which models and versions you want to use. In the navigation menu,
scroll down to the Artificial Intelligence section, and click AI Platform → Models.
Click Activate API (it takes a few minutes), then click “Create model.” Fill in the
model details (see Figure 19-5) and click Create.

8. Now that you have a model on AI Platform, you need to create a model version.
In the list of models, click the model you just created, then click “Create version”
and fill in the version details (see Figure 19-6): set the name, description, Python
version (3.5 or above), framework (TensorFlow), framework version (2.0 if avail‐
able, or 1.13),6 ML runtime version (2.0, if available or 1.13), machine type
(choose “Single core CPU” for now), model path on GCS (this is the full path to
the actual version folder, e.g., <i>gs://my-mnist-model-bucket/my_mnist_model/</i>
<i>0002/),</i> scaling (choose automatic), and minimum number of TF Serving con‐
tainers to have running at all times (leave this field empty). Then click Save.
