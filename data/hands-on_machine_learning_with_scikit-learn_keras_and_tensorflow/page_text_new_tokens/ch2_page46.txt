In typical environments your data would be available in a relational database (or
some other common data store) and spread across multiple tables/documents/files.
To access it, you would first need to get your credentials and access authorizations10
and familiarize yourself with the data schema. In this project, however, things are
much simpler: you will just download a single compressed file, <i>housing.tgz,</i> which
contains a comma-separated values (CSV) file called <i>housing.csv</i> with all the data.
tar xzf housing.tgz
You could use your web browser to download the file and run
to decompress it and extract the CSV file, but it is preferable to create a small func‐
tion to do that. Having a function that downloads the data is useful in particular if the
data changes regularly: you can write a small script that uses the function to fetch the
latest data (or you can set up a scheduled job to do that automatically at regular inter‐
vals). Automating the process of fetching the data is also useful if you need to install
the dataset on multiple machines.
Here is the function to fetch the data: 11
<b>import</b> <b>os</b>
<b>import</b> <b>tarfile</b>
<b>import</b> <b>urllib</b>
DOWNLOAD_ROOT = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/"
HOUSING_PATH = os.path.join("datasets", "housing")
HOUSING_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "datasets/housing/housing.tgz"
<b>def</b> fetch_housing_data(housing_url=HOUSING_URL, housing_path=HOUSING_PATH):
os.makedirs(housing_path, exist_ok=True)
tgz_path = os.path.join(housing_path, "housing.tgz")
urllib.request.urlretrieve(housing_url, tgz_path)
housing_tgz = tarfile.open(tgz_path)
housing_tgz.extractall(path=housing_path)
housing_tgz.close()
fetch_housing_data()
Now when you call , it creates a <i>datasets/housing</i> directory in
your workspace, downloads the <i>housing.tgz</i> file, and extracts the <i>housing.csv</i> file from
it in this directory.
