          load the Better Life Index data from the OECD’s website and stats about gross domes‐
          tic product (GDP) per capita from the IMF’s website. Then you join the tables and
          sort by GDP per capita. Table 1-1 shows an excerpt of what you get.

          Let’s plot the data for these countries (Figure 1-17).      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 1-17. Do you see a trend here?                       
          There does seem to be a trend here! Although the data is noisy (i.e., partly random), it
          looks like life satisfaction goes up more or less linearly as the country’s GDP per cap‐
          ita increases. So you decide to model life satisfaction as a linear function of GDP per
          capita. This step is called model selection: you selected a linear model of life satisfac‐
          tion with just one attribute, GDP per capita (Equation 1-1).
