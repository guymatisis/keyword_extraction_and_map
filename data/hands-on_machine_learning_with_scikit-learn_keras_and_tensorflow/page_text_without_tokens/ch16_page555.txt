          Let’s walk through this figure:                             
                                                                      
           • The lefthand part is the encoder. Just like earlier, it takes as input a batch of sen‐
            tences represented as sequences of word IDs (the input shape is [batch size, max
            input sentence length]), and it encodes each word into a 512-dimensional repre‐
            sentation (so the encoder’s output shape is [batch size, max input sentence length,
            512]). Note that the top part of the encoder is stacked N times (in the paper,
            N = 6).
