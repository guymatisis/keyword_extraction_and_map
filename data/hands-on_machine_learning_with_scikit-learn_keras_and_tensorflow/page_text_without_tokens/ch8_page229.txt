Kernel PCA and the reconstruction pre-image error
                                                                      
          You may be wondering how to perform this reconstruction. One solution is to train a
          supervised regression model, with the projected instances as the training set and the
          original instances as the targets. Scikit-Learn will do this automatically if you set
          fit_inverse_transform=True, as shown in the following code:7
            rbf_pca = KernelPCA(n_components = 2, kernel="rbf", gamma=0.0433,
                        fit_inverse_transform=True)                   
            X_reduced = rbf_pca.fit_transform(X)                      
            X_preimage = rbf_pca.inverse_transform(X_reduced)         
                   By default, fit_inverse_transform=False and KernelPCA has no
                   inverse_transform() method. This method only gets created
                   when you set fit_inverse_transform=True.           
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          7 If you set fit_inverse_transform=True, Scikit-Learn will use the algorithm (based on Kernel Ridge Regres‐
           sion) described in Gokhan H. Bakır et al., “Learning to Find Pre-Images”, Proceedings of the 16th International
           Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (2004): 449–456.
