                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights            
                                                                      
          So far you have only taken a quick glance at the data to get a general understanding of
          the kind of data you are manipulating. Now the goal is to go into a little more depth.
                                                                      
          First, make sure you have put the test set aside and you are only exploring the train‐
          ing set. Also, if the training set is very large, you may want to sample an exploration
          set, to make manipulations easy and fast. In our case, the set is quite small, so you can
          just work directly on the full set. Let’s create a copy so that you can play with it
          without harming the training set:

          Visualizing Geographical Data                               
                                                                      
          Since there is geographical information (latitude and longitude), it is a good idea to
          create a scatterplot of all districts to visualize the data (Figure 2-11):
                                                                      
            housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude")

          This looks like California all right, but other than that it is hard to see any particular
          pattern. Setting the alpha option to 0.1 makes it much easier to visualize the places
          where there is a high density of data points (Figure 2-12): 
                                                                      
            housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", alpha=0.1)
