                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          has a predict_proba() method. Scikit-Learn classifiers generally have one or the
          other, or both. The predict_proba() method returns an array containing a row per
          instance and a column per class, each containing the probability that the given
          instance belongs to the given class (e.g., 70% chance that the image represents a 5):
                                                                      
            from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier       
            forest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)      
            y_probas_forest = cross_val_predict(forest_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3,
                                 method="predict_proba")              
          The roc_curve() function expects labels and scores, but instead of scores you can
          give it class probabilities. Let’s use the positive class’s probability as the score:
            y_scores_forest = y_probas_forest[:, 1] # score = proba of positive class
            fpr_forest, tpr_forest, thresholds_forest = roc_curve(y_train_5,y_scores_forest)
                                                                      
          Now you are ready to plot the ROC curve. It is useful to plot the first ROC curve as
          well to see how they compare (Figure 3-7):                  
            plt.plot(fpr, tpr, "b:", label="SGD")                     
            plot_roc_curve(fpr_forest, tpr_forest, "Random Forest")   
            plt.legend(loc="lower right")                             
            plt.show()                                                
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          Figure 3-7. Comparing ROC curves: the Random Forest classifier is superior to the SGD
          classifier because its ROC curve is much closer to the top-left corner, and it has a greater
          AUC
