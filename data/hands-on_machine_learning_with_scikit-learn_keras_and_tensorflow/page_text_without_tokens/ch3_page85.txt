                                             Classification           
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          In Chapter 1 I mentioned that the most common supervised learning tasks are
          regression (predicting values) and classification (predicting classes). In Chapter 2 we
          explored a regression task, predicting housing values, using various algorithms such
          as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests (which will be explained
          in further detail in later chapters). Now we will turn our attention to classification
          systems.                                                    
          MNIST                                                       
                                                                      
                                                                      
          In this chapter we will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small
          images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Cen‐
          sus Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been stud‐
          ied so much that it is often called the “hello world” of Machine Learning: whenever
          people come up with a new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will
          perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset
          sooner or later.                                            
          Scikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets. MNIST is
          one of them. The following code fetches the MNIST dataset:1 
            >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml             
            >>> mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)          
            >>> mnist.keys()                                          
            dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'feature_names', 'DESCR', 'details',
                   'categories', 'url'])                              
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          1 By default Scikit-Learn caches downloaded datasets in a directory called $HOME/scikit_learn_data.
