                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          reduction algorithm for visualization. Let’s use this strategy to visualize Fashion
          MNIST. First, we use the encoder from our stacked autoencoder to reduce the dimen‐
          sionality down to 30, then we use Scikit-Learn’s implementation of the t-SNE algo‐
          rithm to reduce the dimensionality down to 2 for visualization:
                                                                      
            from sklearn.manifold import TSNE                         
            X_valid_compressed = stacked_encoder.predict(X_valid)     
            tsne = TSNE()                                             
            X_valid_2D = tsne.fit_transform(X_valid_compressed)       
          Now we can plot the dataset:                                
            plt.scatter(X_valid_2D[:, 0], X_valid_2D[:, 1], c=y_valid, s=10, cmap="tab10")
                                                                      
          Figure 17-5 shows the resulting scatterplot (beautified a bit by displaying some of the
          images). The t-SNE algorithm identified several clusters which match the classes rea‐
          sonably well (each class is represented with a different color).

          So, autoencoders can be used for dimensionality reduction. Another application is for
          unsupervised pretraining.
