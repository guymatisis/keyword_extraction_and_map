           In a famous paper published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele Banko and Eric
           Brill showed that very different Machine Learning algorithms, including fairly simple
           ones, performed almost identically well on a complex problem of natural language
           disambiguation8 once they were given enough data (as you can see in Figure 1-20).
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
           Figure 1-20. The importance of data versus algorithms9     
                                                                      
           As the authors put it, “these results suggest that we may want to reconsider the trade-
           off between spending time and money on algorithm development versus spending it
           on corpus development.”                                    
           The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems was further
           popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness
           of Data”, published in 2009.10 It should be noted, however, that small- and medium-
           sized datasets are still very common, and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra
           training data—so don’t abandon algorithms just yet.        
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
          8 For example, knowing whether to write “to,” “two,” or “too,” depending on the context.
