          There are several solutions available for upsampling (increasing the size of an image),
          such as bilinear interpolation, but that only works reasonably well up to ×4 or ×8.
          Instead, they use a transposed convolutional layer:33 it is equivalent to first stretching
          the image by inserting empty rows and columns (full of zeros), then performing a
          regular convolution (see Figure 14-27). Alternatively, some people prefer to think of
          it as a regular convolutional layer that uses fractional strides (e.g., 1/2 in
          Figure 14-27). The transposed convolutional layer can be initialized to perform
          something close to linear interpolation, but since it is a trainable layer, it will learn to
          do better during training. In tf.keras, you can use the Conv2DTranspose layer.

          33 This type of layer is sometimes referred to as a deconvolution layer, but it does not perform what mathemati‐
           cians call a deconvolution, so this name should be avoided.
