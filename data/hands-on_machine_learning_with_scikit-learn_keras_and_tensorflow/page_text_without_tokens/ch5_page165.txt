          No bias feature will be added to the input feature vectors.

          The linear SVM classifier model predicts the class of a new instance x by simply com‐
          puting the decision function w⊺ x + b = w x + ⋯ + w x + b. If the result is positive,

          the predicted class ŷ is the positive class (1), and otherwise it is the negative class (0);
          see Equation 5-2.

          Figure 5-12 shows the decision function that corresponds to the model in the left in
          Figure 5-4: it is a 2D plane because this dataset has two features (petal width and petal
          length). The decision boundary is the set of points where the decision function is
          equal to 0: it is the intersection of two planes, which is a straight line (represented by
          the thick solid line).3

          3 More generally, when there are n features, the decision function is an n-dimensional hyperplane, and the deci‐
           sion boundary is an (n – 1)-dimensional hyperplane.
