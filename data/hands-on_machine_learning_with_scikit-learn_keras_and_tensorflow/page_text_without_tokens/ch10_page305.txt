          Figure 10-12. Learning curves: the mean training loss and accuracy measured over each
          epoch, and the mean validation loss and accuracy measured at the end of each epoch
          You can see that both the training accuracy and the validation accuracy steadily
          increase during training, while the training loss and the validation loss decrease.
          Good! Moreover, the validation curves are close to the training curves, which means
          that there is not too much overfitting. In this particular case, the model looks like it
          performed better on the validation set than on the training set at the beginning of
          training. But thatâ€™s not the case: indeed, the validation error is computed at the end of
          each epoch, while the training error is computed using a running mean during each
          epoch. So the training curve should be shifted by half an epoch to the left. If you do
          that, you will see that the training and validation curves overlap almost perfectly at
          the beginning of training.                                  
                                                                      
                   When plotting the training curve, it should be shifted by half an
                   epoch to the left.
