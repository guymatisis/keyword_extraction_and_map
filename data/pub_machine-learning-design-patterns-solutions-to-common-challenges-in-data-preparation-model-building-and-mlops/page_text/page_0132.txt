Another approach is to use the Cascade pattern, training three separate regression
models for each class. Then, we can use our multidesign pattern solution by passing
our initial classification model an example and using the result of that classification
to decide which regression model to send the example to for numeric prediction.
<b>Anomalydetection</b>
There are two approaches to handling regression models for imbalanced datasets:
• Use the model’s error on a prediction as a signal.
• Cluster incoming data and compare the distance of each new data point to exist‐
ing clusters.
To better understand each solution, let’s say we’re training a model on data collected
by a sensor to predict temperature in the future. In this case, we’d need the model
output to be a numerical value.
For the first approach—using error as a signal—after training a model, we would
then compare the model’s predicted value with the actual value for the current point
in time. If there was a significant difference between the predicted and actual current
value, we could flag the incoming data point as an anomaly. Of course, this requires a
model trained with good accuracy on enough historical data to rely on its quality for
future predictions. The main caveat for this approach is that it requires us to have
new data readily available, so that we can compare the incoming data with the
model’s prediction. As a result, it works best for problems involving streaming or
time-series data.
In the second approach—clustering data—we start by building a model with a clus‐
tering algorithm, a modeling technique that organizes our data into clusters. Cluster‐
ing is an <i>unsupervised</i> <i>learning</i> method, meaning it looks for patterns in the dataset
without any knowledge of ground truth labels. A common clustering algorithm is k-
means, which we can implement with BigQuery ML. The following shows how to
train a k-means model on the BigQuery natality dataset using three features:
