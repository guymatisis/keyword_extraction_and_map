Many financial institutions use machine learning for fraud detection to keep their
consumers’ accounts safe. These machine learning models are trained to flag transac‐
tions that appear fraudulent based on certain characteristics or patterns that have
been learned in the data.
More broadly, anomaly detection is a technique used to find abnormal behavior or
outlier elements in a dataset. Anomalies can arise as spikes or dips that deviate from
the normal patterns, or they can be longer-term abnormal trends. Anomaly detection
shows up through many different use cases in machine learning and might even be
used in conjunction with a separate use case. For example, consider a machine learn‐
ing model that identifies anomalous train tracks based on images.
