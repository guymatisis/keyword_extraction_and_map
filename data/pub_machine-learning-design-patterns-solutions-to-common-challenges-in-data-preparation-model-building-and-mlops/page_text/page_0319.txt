Until this point, we’ve focused on patterns designed to help data and engineering
teams prepare, build, train, and scale models for production use. These patterns
mainly addressed teams directly involved in the ML model development process.
Once a model is in production, its impact extends far beyond the teams who built it.
In this chapter, we’ll discuss the other <i>stakeholders</i> of a model, both those within and
outside of an organization. Stakeholders could include executives whose business
objectives dictate a model’s goals, the end users of a model, auditors, and compliance
regulators.
There are several groups of model stakeholders we’ll be referring to in this chapter:
<i>Model</i> <i>builders</i>
Data scientists and ML researchers directly involved in building ML models.
<i>ML</i> <i>engineers</i>
Members of ML Ops teams directly involved in deploying ML models.
<i>Business</i> <i>decision</i> <i>makers</i>
Decide whether or not to incorporate the ML model into their business processes
or customer-facing applications and will need to evaluate whether the model is
fit for this purpose.
<i>End</i> <i>users</i> <i>of</i> <i>ML</i> <i>systems</i>
Make use of predictions from an ML model. There are many different types of
model end users: customers, employees, and hybrids of these. Examples include a
customer getting a movie recommendation from a model, an employee on a fac‐
tory floor using a visual inspection model to determine whether a product is bro‐
ken, or a medical practitioner using a model to aid in patient diagnosis.
