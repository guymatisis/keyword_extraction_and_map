For each pattern, we describe the commonly occurring problem that is being
addressed and then walk through a variety of potential solutions to the problem, the
trade-offs of these solutions, and recommendations for choosing between these solu‐
tions. Implementation code for these solutions is provided in SQL (useful if you are
carrying out preprocessing and other ETL in Spark SQL, BigQuery, and so on),
scikit-learn, and/or Keras with a TensorFlow backend.

This is a catalog of patterns that we have observed in practice, among multiple teams.
In some cases, the underlying concepts have been known for many years. We don’t
claim to have invented or discovered these patterns. Instead, we hope to provide a
common frame of reference and set of tools for ML practitioners. We will have suc‐
ceeded if this book gives you and your team a vocabulary when talking about con‐
cepts that you already incorporate intuitively into your ML projects.
We don’t expect you to read this book sequentially (although you can!). Instead, we
anticipate that you will skim through the book, read a few sections more deeply than
others, reference the ideas in conversations with colleagues, and refer back to the
book when faced with problems you remember reading about. If you plan to skip
around, we recommend that you start with Chapter 1 and Chapter 8 before dipping
into individual patterns.
Each pattern has a brief problem statement, a canonical solution, an explanation of
why the solution works, and a many-part discussion on tradeoffs and alternatives.
We recommend that you read the discussion section with the canonical solution
firmly in mind, so as to compare and contrast. The pattern description will include
code snippets taken from the implementation of the canonical solution. The full code
can be found in our GitHub repository. We strongly encourage you to peruse the
code as you read the pattern description.

Because machine learning practitioners today may have different areas of primary
expertise—software engineering, data analysis, DevOps, or statistics—there can be
subtle differences in the way that different practitioners use certain terms. In this sec‐
tion, we define terminology that we use throughout the book.
