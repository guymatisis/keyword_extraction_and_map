<b>Aggregatefeature</b>
In cases where the distribution of a categorical variable is skewed or where the num‐
ber of buckets is so small that bucket collisions are frequent, we might find it helpful
to add an aggregate feature as an input to our model. For example, for every airport,
we could find the probability of on-time flights in the training dataset and add it as a
feature to our model. This allows us to avoid losing the information associated with
individual airports when we hash the airport codes. In some cases, we might be able
to avoid using the airport name as a feature entirely, since the relative frequency of
on-time flights might be sufficient.
<b>Hyperparametertuning</b>
Because of the trade-offs with bucket collision frequency, choosing the number of
buckets can be difficult. It very often depends on the problem itself. Therefore, we
recommend that you treat the number of buckets as a hyperparameter that is tuned:
- <b>parameterName:</b> nbuckets
type: INTEGER
minValue: 10
maxValue: 20
scaleType: UNIT_LINEAR_SCALE
Make sure that the number of buckets remains within a sensible range of the cardin‐
ality of the categorical variable being hashed.

What makes the Hashed Feature lossy is the modulo part of the implementation.
What if we were to avoid the modulo altogether? After all, the farm fingerprint has a
fixed length (an INT64 is 64 bits), and so it can be represented using 64 feature val‐
ues, each of which is 0 or 1. This is called <i>binary</i> <i>encoding.</i>
However, binary encoding does not solve the problem of out-of-vocabulary inputs or
cold start (only the problem of high cardinality). In fact, the bitwise coding is a red
herring. If we don’t do a modulo, we can get a unique representation by simply
encoding the three characters that form the IATA code (thus using a feature of length
3*26=78). The problem with this representation is immediately obvious: airports
whose names start with the letter O have nothing in common when it comes to their
flight delay characteristics—the encoding has created a <i>spurious</i> <i>correlation</i> between
airports that start with the same letter. The same insight holds in binary space as well.
Because of this, we do not recommend binary encoding of farm fingerprint values.
Binary encoding of an MD5 hash will not suffer from this spurious correlation prob‐
lem because the output of an MD5 hash is uniformly distributed, and so the resulting
bits will be uniformly distributed. However, unlike the Farm Fingerprint algorithm,
