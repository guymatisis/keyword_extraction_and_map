approach to approximate the precise solution, and concepts like overfitting must be
reevaluated.
For example, a ray-tracing approach is used to simulate the satellite imagery that
would result from the output of numerical weather prediction models. This involves
calculating how much of a solar ray gets absorbed by the predicted hydrometeors
(rain, snow, hail, ice pellets, and so on) at each atmospheric level. There is a finite
number of possible hydrometeor types and a finite number of heights that the
numerical model predicts. So the ray-tracing model has to apply optical equations to
a large but finite set of inputs.
The equations of radiative transfer govern the complex dynamical system of how
electromagnetic radiation propagates in the atmosphere, and forward radiative trans‐
fer models are an effective means of inferring the future state of satellite images.
However, classical numerical methods to compute the solutions to these equations
can take tremendous computational effort and are too slow to use in practice.
Enter machine learning. It is possible to use machine learning to build a model that
approximates solutions to the forward radiative transfer model (see Figure 4-3). This
ML approximation can be made close enough to the solution of the model that was
originally achieved by using more classical methods. The advantage is that inference
using the learned ML approximation (which needs to just calculate a closed formula)
takes only a fraction of the time required to carry out ray tracing (which would
require numerical methods). At the same time, the training dataset is too large (mul‐
tiple terabytes) and too unwieldy to use as a lookup table in production.

There is an important difference between training an ML model to approximate the
solution to a dynamical system like this and training an ML model to predict baby
weight based on natality data collected over the years. Namely, the dynamical system
is a set of equations governed by the laws of electromagnetic radiation—there is no
unobserved variable, no noise, and no statistical variability. For a given set of inputs,
