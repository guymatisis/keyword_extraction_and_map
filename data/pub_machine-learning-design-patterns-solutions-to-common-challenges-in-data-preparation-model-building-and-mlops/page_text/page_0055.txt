This dataset contains information on taxi rides in New York City with features such
as the timestamp of pickup, the pickup and drop-off latitude and longitude, and
number of passengers. The label here is fare_amount , the cost of the taxi ride. Which
feature crosses might be relevant for this dataset?
pickup_datetime
There could be many. Let’s consider the . From this feature, we can
use information about the ride’s hour and day of the week. Each of these is a categori‐
cal variable, and certainly both contain predictive power in determining the price of a
day_of_week
taxi ride. For this dataset, it makes sense to consider a feature cross of
and hour_of_day since it’s reasonable to assume that taxi rides at 5pm on Monday
should be treated differently than taxi rides at 5 p.m. on Friday (see Table 2-9).

A feature cross of these two features would be a 168-dimensional one-hot encoded
vector (24 hours × 7 days = 168) with the example “Monday at 5 p.m.” occupying a
day_of_week hour_of_day
single index denoting ( is Monday concatenated with
is 17).
While the two features are important on their own, allowing for a feature cross of
hour_of_day and day_of_week makes it easier for a taxi fare prediction model to rec‐
ognize that end-of-the-week rush hour influences the taxi ride duration and thus the
taxi fare in its own way.

ML.FEATURE_CROSS
To create the feature cross in BigQuery, we can use the function
and pass in a STRUCT of the features day_of_week and hour_of_day :
ML.FEATURE_CROSS(STRUCT(day_of_week,hour_of_week)) AS day_X_hour
The STRUCT clause creates an ordered pair of the two features. If our software frame‐
work doesn’t support a feature cross function, we can get the same effect using string
concatenation:
CONCAT(CAST(day_of_week AS STRING),
CAST(hour_of_week AS STRING)) AS day_X_hour
