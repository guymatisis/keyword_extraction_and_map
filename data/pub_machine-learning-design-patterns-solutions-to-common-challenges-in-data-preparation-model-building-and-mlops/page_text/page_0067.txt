similar words together, identify relationships between words, and understand syntac‐
tic elements of text. While representing text through word embeddings most closely
mirrors how humans innately understand language, there are additional text repre‐
sentations that can maximize our model’s ability to perform a given prediction task.
In this section, we’ll look at the bag of words approach to representing text, along
with extracting tabular features from text.
To demonstrate text data representation, we’ll be referencing a dataset that contains
the text of millions of questions and answers from Stack Overflow,11 along with
metadata about each post. For example, the following query will give us a subset of
questions tagged as either “keras,” “matplotlib,” or “pandas,” along with the number
of answers each question received:
<b>SELECT</b>
title,
answer_count,
<b>REPLACE(tags,</b> "|", ",") <b>as</b> tags
<b>FROM</b>
`bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
<b>WHERE</b>
REGEXP_CONTAINS( tags, r"(?:keras|matplotlib|pandas)")
The query results in the following output:
<b>Row</b> <b>title</b> <b>answer_count</b> <b>tags</b>

When representing text using the bag of words (BOW) approach, we imagine each
text input to our model as a bag of Scrabble tiles, with each tile containing a single
word instead of a letter. BOW does not preserve the order of our text, but it does
detect the presence or absence of certain words in each piece of text we send to our
model. This approach is a type of multi-hot encoding where each text input is con‐
verted into an array of 1s and 0s. Each index in this BOW array corresponds to a
word from our vocabulary.
