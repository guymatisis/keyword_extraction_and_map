meal_type
, so we can turn this into a one-hot encoding and will represent dinner as
[ 0, 0, 1 ]. With this categorical feature represented as an array, we can now combine
it with meal_total by adding the price of the meal as the fourth element of the array:
0, 0, 1, 30.5
[ ].
The Embeddings design pattern is a common approach to encoding text for machine
learning models. If our model had only text, we could represent it as an embedding
tf.keras
layer using the following code:
<b>from</b> <b>tensorflow.keras</b> <b>import</b> Sequential
<b>from</b> <b>tensorflow.keras.layers</b> <b>import</b> Embedding
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(batch_size, 64, input_length=30))
Here, we need to flatten the embedding8 in order to concatenate with the meal_type
and meal_total :
model.add(Flatten())
We could then use a series of Dense layers to transform that very large array9 into
smaller ones, ending with our output that is an array of, say, three numbers:
model.add(Dense(3, activation="relu"))
We now need to concatenate these three numbers, which form the sentence embed‐
ding of the review with the earlier inputs: [0, 0, 1, 30.5, 0.75, -0.82, 0.45].
To do this, we’ll use the Keras functional API and apply the same steps. Layers built
with the functional API are callable, enabling us to chain them together starting with
an Input layer . 10 To make use of this, we’ll first define both our embedding and tab‐
ular layers:
embedding_input = Input(shape=(30,))
embedding_layer = Embedding(batch_size, 64)(embedding_input)
embedding_layer = Flatten()(embedding_layer)
embedding_layer = Dense(3, activation='relu')(embedding_layer)
tabular_input = Input(shape=(4,))
tabular_layer = Dense(32, activation='relu')(tabular_input)
Note that we’ve defined the Input pieces of both of these layers as their own vari‐
Model
ables. This is because we need to pass Input layers when we build a with the
