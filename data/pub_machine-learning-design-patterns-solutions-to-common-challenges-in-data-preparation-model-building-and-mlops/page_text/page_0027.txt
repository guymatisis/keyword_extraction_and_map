bucket boundaries to fit the desired output distribution. A principled approach to
choosing these buckets is to do <i>histogram</i> <i>equalization,</i> where the bins of the histo‐
gram are chosen based on quantiles of the raw distribution, (see the third panel of
Figure 2-4). In the ideal situation, histogram equalization results in a uniform distri‐
bution (although not in this case, because of repeated values in the quantiles).
To carry out histogram equalization in BigQuery, we can do:
ML.BUCKETIZE(num_views, bins) <b>AS</b> bin
where the bins are obtained from:
APPROX_QUANTILES(num_views, 100) <b>AS</b> bins
See the notebook in the code repository of this book for full details.
Another method to handle skewed distributions is to use a parametric transforma‐
tion technique like the <i>Box-Cox</i> <i>transform.</i> Box-Cox chooses its single parameter,
lambda, to control the “heteroscedasticity” so that the variance no longer depends on
the magnitude. Here, the variance among rarely viewed Wikipedia pages will be
much smaller than the variance among frequently viewed pages, and Box-Cox tries to
equalize the variance across all ranges of the number of views. This can be done using
Python’s SciPy package:
traindf['boxcox'], est_lambda = (
scipy.stats.boxcox(traindf['num_views']))
The parameter estimated over the training dataset (est_lambda) is then used to
transform other values:
evaldf['boxcox'] = scipy.stats.boxcox(evaldf['num_views'], est_lambda)
<b>Arrayofnumbers</b>
Sometimes, the input data is an array of numbers. If the array is of fixed length, data
representation can be rather simple: flatten the array and treat each position as a sep‐
arate feature. But often, the array will be of variable length. For example, one of the
inputs to the model to predict the sales of a nonfiction book might be the sales of all
previous books on the topic. An example input might be:
[2100, 15200, 230000, 1200, 300, 532100]
Obviously, the length of this array will vary in each row because there are different
numbers of books published on different topics.
