First, we identify a column that captures the correlation relationship between rows.
In our airline delay dataset, this is the date column. Then, we use the last few digits of
a hash function on that column to split the data. For the airline delay problem, we
date
can use the Farm Fingerprint hashing algorithm on the column to split the
available data into training, validation, and testing datasets.
For more on the Farm Fingerprint algorithm, support for other
frameworks and languages, and the relationship between hashing
and cryptography, please see “Design Pattern 1: Hashed Feature”
on page 32 in Chapter 2. In particular, open source wrappers of the
Farm Hash algorithm are available in a number of languages
(including Python), and so this pattern can be applied even if data
is not in a data warehouse that supports a repeatable hash out of
the box.
date
Here is how to split the dataset based on the hash of the column:
<b>SELECT</b>
airline,
departure_airport,
departure_schedule,
arrival_airport,
arrival_delay
<b>FROM</b>
`bigquery-samples`.airline_ontime_data.flights
<b>WHERE</b>
<b>ABS(MOD(FARM_FINGERPRINT(date),</b> 10)) < 8 <i>--</i> <i>80%</i> <i>for</i> <i>TRAIN</i>
To split on the date column, we compute its hash using the FARM_FINGERPRINT func‐
tion and then use the modulo function to find an arbitrary 80% subset of the rows.
FARM_FINGERPRINT
This is now repeatable—because the function returns the same
value any time it is invoked on a specific date, we can be sure we will get the same
80% of data each time. As a result, all the flights on any given date will belong to the
same split—train, validation, or test. This is repeatable regardless of the random seed.
arrival_airport
If we want to split our data by (so that 80% of airports are in the
training dataset, perhaps because we are trying to predict something about airport
arrival_airport date
amenities), we would compute the hash on instead of .
< 8
It is also straightforward to get the validation data: change the in the query above
to =8 , and for testing data, change it to =9 . This way, we get 10% of samples in valida‐
tion and 10% in testing.
date
What are the considerations for choosing the column to split on? The column
has to have several characteristics for us to be able to use it as the splitting column:
