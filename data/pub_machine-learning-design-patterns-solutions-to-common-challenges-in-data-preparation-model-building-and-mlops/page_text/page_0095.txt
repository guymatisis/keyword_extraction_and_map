<b>Parsingsigmoidresults</b>
To extract the predicted label for a model with softmax output, we can simply take
the argmax (highest value index) of the output array to get the predicted class. Pars‐
ing sigmoid outputs is less straightforward. Instead of taking the class with the high‐
est predicted probability, we need to evaluate the probability of each class in our
output layer and consider the probability <i>threshold</i> for our use case. Both of these
choices are largely dependent on the end user application of our model.
By threshold, we’re referring to the probability we’re comfortable
with for confirming an input belongs to a particular class. For
example, if we’re building a model to classify different types of ani‐
mals in images, we might be comfortable saying an image has a cat
even if the model is only 80% confident the image contains a cat.
Alternatively, if we’re building a model that’s making healthcare
predictions, we’ll likely want the model to be closer to 99% confi‐
dent before confirming a specific medical condition is present or
not. While thresholding is something we’ll need to consider for any
type of classification model, it’s especially relevant to the Multilabel
design pattern since we’ll need to determine thresholds for each
class and they may be different.
To look at a specific example, let’s take the Stack Overflow dataset in BigQuery and
use it to build a model that predicts the tags associated with a Stack Overflow ques‐
tion given its title. We’ll limit our dataset to questions that contain only five tags to
keep things simple:
SELECT
title,
REPLACE(tags, "|", ",") <b>as</b> tags
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
WHERE
