In some circumstances, it can be helpful to treat a numeric input as categorical and
map it to a one-hot encoded column:
<i>When</i> <i>the</i> <i>numeric</i> <i>input</i> <i>is</i> <i>an</i> <i>index</i>
For example, if we are trying to predict traffic levels and one of our inputs is the
day of the week, we could treat the day of the week as numeric (1, 2, 3, …, 7), but
it is helpful to recognize that the day of the week here is not a continuous scale
but really just an index. It is better to treat it as categorical (Sunday, Monday, …,
Saturday) because the indexing is arbitrary. Should the week start on Sunday (as
in the USA), Monday (as in France), or Saturday (as in Egypt)?
<i>When</i> <i>the</i> <i>relationship</i> <i>between</i> <i>input</i> <i>and</i> <i>label</i> <i>is</i> <i>not</i> <i>continuous</i>
What should tip the scale toward treating day of the week as a categorical feature
is that traffic levels on Friday are not affected by those on Thursday and
Saturday.
<i>When</i> <i>it</i> <i>is</i> <i>advantageous</i> <i>to</i> <i>bucket</i> <i>the</i> <i>numeric</i> <i>variable</i>
In most cities, traffic levels depend on whether it is the weekend, and this can
vary by location (Saturday and Sunday in most of the world, Thursday and Fri‐
day in some Islamic countries). It would be helpful to then treat day of the week
as a boolean feature (weekend or weekday). Such a mapping where the number
of distinct inputs (here, seven) is greater than the number of distinct feature val‐
ues (here, two) is called bucketing. Commonly, bucketing is done in terms of
mother_age
ranges—for example, we might bucket into ranges that break at 20,
25, 30, etc. and treat each of these bins as categorical, but it should be realized
that this loses the ordinal nature of mother_age .
<i>When</i> <i>we</i> <i>want</i> <i>to</i> <i>treat</i> <i>different</i> <i>values</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>numeric</i> <i>input</i> <i>as</i> <i>being</i> <i>independent</i>
<i>when</i> <i>it</i> <i>comes</i> <i>to</i> <i>their</i> <i>effect</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>label</i>
For example, the weight of a baby depends on the plurality2 of the delivery since
twins and triplets tend to weigh less than single births. So, a lower-weight baby, if
part of a triplet, might be healthier than a twin baby with the same weight. In this
case, we might map the plurality to a categorical variable, since a categorical vari‐
able allows the model to learn independent tunable parameters for the different
values of plurality. Of course, we can do this only if we have enough examples of
twins and triplets in our dataset.
