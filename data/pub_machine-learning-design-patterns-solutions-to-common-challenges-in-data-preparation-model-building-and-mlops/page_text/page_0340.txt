more in-depth overview of the What-If Tool in the Fairness Lens design pattern—
here, we’ll focus specifically on its counterfactual analysis functionality. When visual‐
izing data points from our test set in the What-If Tool, we have the option to show
the nearest counterfactual data point to the one we’re selecting. Doing this will let us
compare feature values and model predictions for these two data points, which can
help us better understand the features our model is relying on most. In Figure 7-7, we
see a counterfactual comparison for two data points from a mortgage application
dataset. In bold, we see the features where these two data points are different, and at
the bottom, we can see the model output for each.
Example-based explanations compare new examples and their corresponding predic‐
tions to similar examples from our training dataset. This type of explanation is espe‐
cially useful for understanding how our training dataset affects model behavior.
Example-based explanations work best on image or text data, and can be more intu‐
itive than feature attributions or counterfactual analysis since they map a model’s
prediction directly to the data used for training.
