IoT analytics is also a broad category that sits within predictive analytics. IoT models
rely on data collected by internet-connected sensors called IoT devices. Consider a
commercial aircraft that has thousands of sensors on it collecting more than 2 TB of
data per day. Machine learning of IoT sensor device data can provide predictive
models to warn against equipment failure before it happens.
