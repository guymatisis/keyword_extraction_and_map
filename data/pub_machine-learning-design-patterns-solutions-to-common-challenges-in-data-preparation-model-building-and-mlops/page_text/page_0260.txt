• Rows at the same date tend to be correlated—again, this is the key reason why we
want to ensure that all rows on the same date are in the same split.
date
• is not an input to the model even though it is used as a criteria for splitting.
Features extracted from date such as day of week or hour of day can be inputs,
but we can’t use an actual input as the field with which to split because the
date
trained model will not have seen 20% of the possible input values for the
column if we use 80% of the data for training.
date
• There have to be enough values. Since we are computing the hash and find‐
ing the modulo with respect to 10, we need at least 10 unique hash values. The
more unique values we have, the better. To be safe, a rule of thumb is to shoot for
3–5× the denominator for the modulo, so in this case, we want 40 or so unique
dates.
• The label has to be well distributed among the dates. If it turns out that all the
delays happened on January 1 and there were no delays the rest of the year, this
wouldn’t work since the split datasets will be skewed. To be safe, look at a graph
and make sure that all three splits have a similar distribution of labels. To be
extra safe, ensure that the distributions of label by departure delay and other
input values are similar across the three datasets.
We can automate checking whether the label distributions are sim‐
ilar across the three datasets by using the Kolomogorov–Smirnov
test: just plot the cumulative distribution functions of the label in
the three datasets and find the maximum distance between each
pair. The smaller the maximum distance, the better the split.

Let’s look at a couple of variants of how we might do repeatable splitting and discuss
the pros and cons of each. Let’s also examine how to extend this idea to do repeatable
sampling, not just splitting.
<b>Singlequery</b>
We don’t need three separate queries to generate training, validation, and test splits.
We can do it in a single query as follows:
<b>CREATE</b> <b>OR</b> <b>REPLACE</b> <b>TABLE</b> mydataset.mytable <b>AS</b>
<b>SELECT</b>

departure_airport,
departure_schedule,
arrival_airport,
