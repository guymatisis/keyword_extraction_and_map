Common idioms to handle arrays of numbers include the following:
• Representing the input array in terms of its bulk statistics. For example, we might
use the length (that is, count of previous books on topic), average, median, mini‐
mum, maximum, and so forth.
• Representing the input array in terms of its empirical distribution—i.e., by the
10th/20th/... percentile, and so on.
• If the array is ordered in a specific way (for example, in order of time or by size),
representing the input array by the last three or some other fixed number of
items. For arrays of length less than three, the feature is padded to a length of
three with missing values.
All these end up representing the variable-length array of data as a fixed-length fea‐
ture. We could have also formulated this problem as a time-series forecasting prob‐
lem, as the problem of forecasting the sales of the next book on the topic based on the
time history of sales of previous books. By treating the sales of previous books as an
array input, we are assuming that the most important factors in predicting a book’s
sales are characteristics of the book itself (author, publisher, reviews, and so on) and
not the temporal continuity of the sales amounts.

Because most modern, large-scale machine learning models (random forests, support
vector machines, neural networks) operate on numerical values, categorical inputs
have to be represented as numbers.
Simply enumerating the possible values and mapping them to an ordinal scale will
work poorly. Suppose that one of the inputs to the model that predicts the sales of a
nonfiction book is the language that the book is written in. We can’t simply create a
mapping table like this:
<b>Categoricalinput</b> <b>Numericfeature</b>
English 1.0
Chinese 2.0
German 3.0
This is because the machine learning model will then attempt to interpolate between
the popularity of German and English books to get the popularity of the book in Chi‐
nese! Because there is no ordinal relationship between languages, we need to use a
categorical to numeric mapping that allows the model to learn the market for books
written in these languages independently.
