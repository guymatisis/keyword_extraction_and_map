approximate the complex target than a regression model. At inference time, the
model then predicts a collection of probabilities corresponding to these potential out‐
puts. That is, we obtain a discrete PDF giving the relative likelihood of any specific
weight. Of course, care has to be taken here—classification models can be hugely
uncalibrated (such as the model being overly confident and wrong).

In some scenarios, reframing a classification task as a regression could be beneficial.
For example, suppose we had a large movie database with customer ratings on a scale
from 1 to 5, for all movies that the user had watched and rated. Our task is to build a
machine learning model that will be used to serve recommendations to our users.
Viewed as a classification task, we could consider building a model that takes as input
user_id
a , along with that user’s previous video watches and ratings, and predicts
which movie from our database to recommend next. However, it is possible to
reframe this problem as a regression. Instead of the model having a categorical out‐
put corresponding to a movie in our database, our model could instead carry out
multitask learning, with the model learning a number of key characteristics (such as
income, customer segment, and so on) of users who are likely to watch a given movie.
Reframed as a regression task, the model now predicts the user-space representation
for a given movie. To serve recommendations, we choose the set of movies that are
closest to the known characteristics of a user. In this way, instead of the model pro‐
viding the probability that a user will like a movie as in a classification, we would get
a cluster of movies that have been watched by users like this user.
By reframing the classification problem of recommending movies to be a regression
of user characteristics, we gain the ability to easily adapt our recommendation model
to recommend trending videos, or classic movies, or documentaries without having
to train a separate classification model each time.
This type of model approach is also useful when the numerical representation has an
intuitive interpretation; for example, a latitude and longitude pair can be used instead
of urban area predictions. Suppose we wanted to predict which city will experience
the next viral outbreak or which New York neighborhood will have a real estate pric‐
ing surge. It could be easier to predict the latitude and longitude and choose the city
or neighborhood closest to that location, rather than predicting the city or neighbor‐
hood itself.

There is rarely just one way to frame a problem, and it is helpful to be aware of any
trade-offs or alternatives of a given implementation. For example, bucketizing the
output values of a regression is an approach to reframing the problem as a classifica‐
