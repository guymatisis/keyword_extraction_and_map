<b>Strategicphase:Utilizingpipelines</b>
Organizations in the strategic phase have aligned AI efforts with business objectives
and priorities, and ML is seen as a pivotal accelerator for the business. As such, there
is often senior executive sponsorship and dedicated budget for ML projects that are
executed by skilled teams and strategic partners. There is infrastructure in place for
these teams to easily share assets and develop ML systems that leverage both ready-
to-use and custom models. There is a clear distinction between development and
production environments.
Teams typically already have skills in data wrangling with expertise in descriptive and
predictive analytics. Data is stored in an enterprise data warehouse, and there is a
unified model for centralized data and ML asset management. The development of
ML models occurs as an orchestrated experiment. The ML assets and source code for
these pipelines is stored in a centralized source repository and easily shared among
members of the organization.
The data pipelines for developing ML models are automated utilizing a fully man‐
aged, serverless data service for ingestion and processing and are either scheduled or
event driven. Additionally, the ML workflow for training, evaluation, and batch pre‐
diction is managed by an automated pipeline so that the stages of the ML life cycle,
from data validation and preparation to model training and validation (see
Figure 8-5), are executed by a performance monitoring trigger. These models are
stored in a centralized trained models registry and able to be deployed automatically
based on predetermined model validation metrics.
There may be several ML systems deployed and maintained in production with log‐
ging, performance monitoring, and notifications in place. The ML systems leverage a
