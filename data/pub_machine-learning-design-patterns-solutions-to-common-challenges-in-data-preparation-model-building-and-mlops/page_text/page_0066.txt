Here’s what this might look like for a small dataset with three data points:
rating_data = [2, 3, 5]
<b>def</b> good_or_bad(rating):
<b>if</b> rating > 3:
<b>return</b> 1
<b>else:</b>
<b>return</b> 0
rating_processed = []
<b>for</b> i <b>in</b> rating_data:
rating_processed.append([i, good_or_bad(i)])
The resulting feature is a two-element array consisting of the integer rating and its
boolean representation:
[[2, 0], [3, 0], [5, 1]]
If we had instead decided to create more than two buckets, we would one-hot encode
each input and append this one-hot array to the integer representation.
The reason it’s useful to represent rating in two ways is because the value of rating as
measured by 1 to 5 stars does not necessarily increase linearly. Ratings of 4 and 5 are
very similar, and ratings of 1 to 3 most likely indicate that the reviewer was dissatis‐
fied. Whether you give something you dislike 1, 2, or 3 stars is often related to your
review tendencies rather than the review itself. Despite this, it’s still useful to keep the
more granular information present in the star rating, which is why we encode it in
two ways.
Additionally, consider features with a larger range than 1 to 5, like the distance
between a reviewer’s home and a restaurant. If someone drives two hours to go to a
restaurant, their review may be more critical than someone coming from across the
street. In this case, we might have outlier values, and so it would make sense to both
threshold the numeric distance representation at something like 50 km and to
include a separate categorical representation of distance. The categorical feature
could be bucketed into “in state,” “in country,” and “foreign.”

Both text and images are unstructured and require more transformations than tabu‐
lar data. Representing them in various formats can help our models extract more pat‐
terns. We’ll build on our discussion of text models in the preceding section by
looking at different approaches for representing text data. Then we’ll introduce
images and dive into a few options for representing image data in ML models.
