class_weights
In Keras, we can pass a parameter to our model when we train it with
fit() . The parameter class_weights is a dict, mapping each class to the weight
Keras should assign to examples from that class. But how should we determine the
exact weights for each class? The class weight values should relate to the balance of
each class in our dataset. For example, if the minority class accounts for only 0.1% of
the dataset, a reasonable conclusion is that our model should treat examples from
that class with 1000× more weight than the majority class. In practice, it’s common to
divide this weight value by 2 for each class so that the average weight of an example is
<i>1.0.</i> Therefore, given a dataset with 0.1% of values representing the minority class, we
could calculate the class weights with the following code:
num_minority_examples = 1
num_majority_examples = 999
total_examples = num_minority_examples + num_majority_examples
minority_class_weight = 1/(num_minority_examples/total_examples)/2
majority_class_weight = 1/(num_majority_examples/total_examples)/2
<i>#</i> <i>Pass</i> <i>the</i> <i>weights</i> <i>to</i> <i>Keras</i> <i>in</i> <i>a</i> <i>dict</i>
<i>#</i> <i>The</i> <i>key</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>index</i> <i>of</i> <i>each</i> <i>class</i>
keras_class_weights = {0: majority_class_weight, 1: minority_class_weight}
We’d then pass these weights to our model during training:
model.fit(
train_data,
train_labels,
class_weight=keras_class_weights
)
In BigQuery ML, we can set AUTO_CLASS_WEIGHTS = True in the OPTIONS block when
creating our model to have different classes weighted based on their frequency of
occurrence in the training data.
While it can be helpful to follow a heuristic of class balance for setting class weights,
the business application of a model might also dictate the class weights we choose to
assign. For example, let’s say we have a model classifying images of defective prod‐
ucts. If the cost of shipping a defective product is 10 times that of incorrectly classify‐
ing a normal product, we would choose 10 as the weight for our minority class.
