term for preprocessing is <i>feature</i> <i>engineering.</i> We’ll use these two terms interchangea‐
bly throughout the book.
There are various terms used to describe data as it goes through the feature engineer‐
ing process. <i>Input</i> describes a single column in your dataset before it has been pro‐
cessed, and <i>feature</i> describes a single column <i>after</i> it has been processed. For
example, a timestamp could be your input, and the feature would be day of the week.
To convert the data from timestamp to day of the week, you’ll need to do some data
preprocessing. This preprocessing step can also be referred to as <i>data</i> <i>transformation.</i>
An <i>instance</i> is an item you’d like to send to your model for prediction. An instance
could be a row in your test dataset (without the label column), an image you want to
classify, or a text document to send to a sentiment analysis model. Given a set of fea‐
tures about the instance, the model will calculate a predicted value. In order to do
that, the model is trained on <i>training</i> <i>examples,</i> which associate an instance with a
<i>label.</i> A <i>training</i> <i>example</i> refers to a single instance (row) of data from your dataset
that will be fed to your model. Building on the timestamp use case, a full training
example might include: “day of week,” “city,” and “type of car.” A <i>label</i> is the output
column in your dataset—the item your model is predicting. <i>Label</i> can refer both to
the target column in your dataset (also called a <i>ground</i> <i>truth</i> <i>label)</i> and the output
given by your model (also called a <i>prediction).</i> A sample label for the training exam‐
ple outlined above could be “trip duration”—in this case, a float value denoting
minutes.
Once you’ve assembled your dataset and determined the features for your model,
<i>data</i> <i>validation</i> is the process of computing statistics on your data, understanding
your schema, and evaluating the dataset to identify problems like drift and training-
serving skew. Evaluating various statistics on your data can help you ensure the data‐
set contains a balanced representation of each feature. In cases where it’s not possible
to collect more data, understanding data balance will help you design your model to
account for this. Understanding your schema involves defining the data type for each
feature and identifying training examples where certain values may be incorrect or
missing. Finally, data validation can identify inconsistencies that may affect the qual‐
ity of your training and test sets. For example, maybe the majority of your training
dataset contains <i>weekday</i> examples while your test set contains primarily <i>weekend</i>
examples.

The first step in a typical machine learning workflow is <i>training—the</i> process of pass‐
ing training data to a model so that it can learn to identify patterns. After training,
the next step in the process is testing how your model performs on data outside of
your training set. This is known as model <i>evaluation.</i> You might run training and
evaluation multiple times, performing additional feature engineering and tweaking
