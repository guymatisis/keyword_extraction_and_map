designing your model. You can then find a balance between the product team’s goal
of optimizing for precision and your goal of minimizing the model’s loss.
When defining the goals for your model, it’s important to consider the needs of dif‐
ferent teams across an organization, and how each team’s needs relate back to the
model. By analyzing what each team is optimizing for before building out your solu‐
tion, you can find areas of compromise in order to optimally balance these multiple
objectives.

Design patterns are a way to codify the knowledge and experience of experts into
advice that all practitioners can follow. The design patterns in this book capture best
practices and solutions to commonly occurring problems in designing, building, and
deploying machine learning systems. The common challenges in machine learning
tend to revolve around data quality, reproducibility, data drift, scale, and having to
satisfy multiple objectives.
We tend to use different ML design patterns at different stages of the ML life cycle.
There are patterns that are useful in problem framing and assessing feasibility. The
majority of patterns address either development or deployment, and quite a few pat‐
terns address the interplay between these stages.
