conjunction with the Stateless Serving Function pattern to carry out prediction jobs
at scale which, in turn, relies on the Transform pattern under the hood to maintain
consistency between training and serving.

Machine learning systems enable teams within an organization to build, deploy, and
maintain machine learning solutions at scale. They provide a platform for automat‐
ing and accelerating all stages of the ML life cycle, from managing data, to training
models, evaluating performance, deploying models, serving predictions, and moni‐
toring performance. The patterns we have discussed in this book show up throughout
any machine learning project. In this section, we’ll describe the stages of the ML life
cycle and where many of these patterns are likely to arise.

Building a machine learning solution is a cyclical process that begins with a clear
understanding of the business goals and ultimately leads to having a machine learn‐
ing model in production that benefits that goal. This high-level overview of the ML
life cycle (see Figure 8-2) provides a useful roadmap designed to enable ML to bring
value to businesses. Each of the stages is equally important, and failure to complete
any one of these steps increases the risk in later stages of producing misleading
insights or models of no value.
