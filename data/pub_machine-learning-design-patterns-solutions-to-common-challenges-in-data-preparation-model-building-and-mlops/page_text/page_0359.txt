We set out to create a catalog of machine learning design patterns, solutions to recur‐
ring problems when designing, training, and deploying machine learning models and
pipelines. In this chapter, we provide a quick reference to this inventory of patterns.
We organized the patterns in the book in terms of where they would be used in a typ‐
ical ML workflow. Thus, we had a chapter on input representation and another on
model selection. We then discussed patterns that modify the typical training loop and
make inference more resilient. We ended with patterns that promote a responsible
use of ML systems. This is akin to organizing a recipe book with separate sections on
appetizers, soups, entrees, and desserts. Such an organization, however, can make it
hard to determine when to choose which soup and what desserts go well with some
entree. Therefore, in this chapter, we also draw out how the patterns are related to
one another. Finally, we also put together “meal plans” by discussing how the pat‐
terns interact for common categories of ML tasks.

We’ve discussed a lot of different design patterns and how they can be used to
address common challenges that arise in machine learning. Here is a summary.
