Computer vision is the broad parent name for AI that trains machines to understand
visual input, such as images, videos, icons, and anything where pixels might be
involved. Computer vision models aim to automate any task that might rely on
human vision, from using an MRI to detect lung cancer to self-driving cars. Some
classical applications of computer vision are image classification, video motion analy‐
sis, image segmentation, and image denoising.

Predictive modeling uses historical data to find patterns and determine the likelihood
of a certain event occurring in the future. Predictive models can be found across
many different industry domains. For example, businesses might use predictive mod‐
els to forecast revenue more accurately or anticipate future demand for products. In
medicine, predictive models might be used to assess the risk of a patient developing a
chronic disease or predict when a patient might not show up for a scheduled
