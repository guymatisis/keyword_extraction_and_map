Before proceeding with the tools outlined in this section, it’s worth
analyzing both the dataset and prediction task to determine
whether there is potential for problematic bias. This requires look‐
ing closer at <i>who</i> will be impacted by a model, and <i>how</i> those
groups will be impacted. If problematic bias seems likely, the tech‐
nical approaches outlined in this section provide a good starting
point for mitigating this type of bias. If, on the other hand, the
skew in the dataset contains naturally occurring bias that will not
have adverse effects on different groups of people, “Design Pattern
10: Rebalancing ” on page 122 in Chapter 3 provides solutions for
handling data that is inherently imbalanced.
Throughout this section, we’ll be referencing a public dataset of US mortgage appli‐
cations. Loan agencies in the US are required to report information on an individual
application, like the type of loan, the applicant’s income, the agency handling the
loan, and the status of the application. We will train a loan application approval
model on this dataset in order to demonstrate different aspects of fairness. To our
knowledge, this dataset is not used as is by any loan agency to train ML models, and
so the fairness red flags we raise are only hypothetical.
We’ve created a subset of this dataset and done some preprocessing to turn this into a
binary classification problem—whether an application was approved or denied. In
Figure 7-9, we can see a preview of the dataset.

<b>Beforetraining</b>
Because ML models are a direct representation of the data used to train them, it’s
possible to mitigate a significant amount of bias <i>before</i> building or training a model
by performing thorough data analysis, and using the results of this analysis to adjust
our data. In this phase, focus on identifying data collection or data representation
bias, outlined in the Problem section. Table 7-3 shows some questions to consider for
each type of bias depending on data type.
