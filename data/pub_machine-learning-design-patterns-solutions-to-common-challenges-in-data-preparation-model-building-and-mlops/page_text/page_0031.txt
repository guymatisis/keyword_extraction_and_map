<b>Arrayofcategoricalvariables</b>
Sometimes, the input data is an array of categories. If the array is of fixed length, we
can treat each array position as a separate feature. But often, the array will be of vari‐
able length. For example, one of the inputs to the natality model might be the type of
previous births to this mother:
[Induced, Induced, Natural, Cesarean]
Obviously, the length of this array will vary in each row because there are different
numbers of older siblings for each baby.
Common idioms to handle arrays of categorical variables include the following:
• <i>Counting</i> the number of occurrences of each vocabulary item. So, the representa‐
[2, 1, 1]
tion for our example would be assuming that the vocabulary is
Induced, Natural , and Cesarean (in that order). This is now a fixed-length
array of numbers that can be flattened and used in positional order. If we have an
array where an item can occur only once (for example, of languages a person
speaks), or if the feature just indicates presence and not count (such as whether
the mother has ever had a Cesarean operation), then the count at each position is
0 or 1, and this is called <i>multi-hot</i> <i>encoding.</i>
• To avoid large numbers, the <i>relative</i> <i>frequency</i> can be used instead of the count.
The representation for our example would be [0.5, 0.25, 0.25] instead of [2,
1, 1] . Empty arrays (first-born babies with no previous siblings) are represented
[0, 0, 0].
as In natural language processing, the relative frequency of a word
overall is normalized by the relative frequency of documents that contain the
word to yield TF-IDF (short for term frequency–inverse document frequency).
TF-IDF reflects how unique a word is to a document.
• If the array is ordered in a specific way (e.g., in order of time), representing the
input array by the last three items. Arrays shorter than three are padded with
missing values.
• Representing the array by bulk statistics, e.g., the length of the array, the mode
(most common entry), the median, the 10th/20th/… percentile, etc.
Of these, the counting/relative-frequency idiom is the most common. Note that both
of these are a generalization of one-hot encoding—if the baby had no older siblings,
the representation would be [0, 0, 0] , and if the baby had one older sibling who
[0, 1, 0]
was born in a natural birth, the representation would be .
Having seen simple data representations, let’s discuss design patterns that help with
data representation.
