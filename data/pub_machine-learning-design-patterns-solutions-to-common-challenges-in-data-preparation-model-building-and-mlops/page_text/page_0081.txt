Instead of trying to predict the amount of rainfall as a regression task, we can reframe
our objective as a classification problem. There are different ways this can be accom‐
plished. One approach is to model a discrete probability distribution, as shown in
Figure 3-1. Instead of predicting rainfall as a real-valued output, we model the output
as a multiclass classification giving the probability that the rainfall in the next 15
minutes is within a certain range of rainfall amounts.

Both the regression approach and this reframed-as-classification approach give a pre‐
diction of the rainfall for the next 15 minutes. However, the classification approach
allows the model to capture the probability distribution of rainfall of different quanti‐
ties instead of having to choose the mean of the distribution. Modeling a distribution
in this way is advantageous since precipitation does not exhibit the typical bell-
shaped curve of a normal distribution and instead follows a Tweedie distribution,
which allows for a preponderance of points at zero. Indeed, that’s the approach taken
in a Google Research paper that predicts precipitation rates in a given location using
a 512-way categorical distribution. Other reasons that modeling a distribution can be
advantageous is when the distribution is bimodal, or even when it is normal but with
a large variance. A recent paper that beats all benchmarks at predicting protein fold‐
ing structure also predicts the distance between amino acids as a 64-way classification
problem where the distances are bucketized into 64 bins.
Another reason to reframe a problem is when the objective is better in the other type
of model. For example, suppose we are trying to build a recommendation system for
