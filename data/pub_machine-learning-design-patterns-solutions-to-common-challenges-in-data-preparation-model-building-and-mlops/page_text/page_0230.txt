once each quarter, it doesn’t make sense to train more frequently than that. However,
if the volume and occurrence of new data is high, then it would be beneficial to
retrain more frequently. The most extreme version of this is online machine learning.
Some machine learning applications, such as ad placement or newsfeed recommen‐
dation, require online, real-time decision, and can continuously improve perfor‐
mance by retraining and updating parameter weights with each new training
example.
In general, the optimal time frame is something you as a practitioner will determine
through experience and experimentation. If you are trying to model a rapidly moving
task, such as adversary or competitive behavior, then it makes sense to set a more fre‐
quent retraining schedule. If the problem is fairly static, like predicting a baby’s birth
weight, then less frequent retrainings should suffice.
In either case, it is helpful to have an automated pipeline set up that can execute the
full retraining process with a single API call. Tools like Cloud Composer/Apache Air‐
flow and AI Platform Pipelines are useful to create, schedule, and monitor ML work‐
flows from preprocessing raw data and training to hyperparameter tuning and
deployment. We discuss this further in the next chapter in “Design Pattern 25: Work‐
flow Pipeline”.

Data distributions can change over time, as shown in Figure 5-7. For example, con‐
sider the natality birth weight dataset. As medicine and societal standards change
over time, the relationship between model features, such as the mother’s age or the
number of gestation weeks, change with respect to the model label, the weight of the
baby. This data drift negatively impacts the model’s ability to generalize to new data.
In short, your model has gone <i>stale,</i> and it needs to be retrained on fresh data.
