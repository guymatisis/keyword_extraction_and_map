Nevertheless, in practice, each specific chaotic phenomenon has a specific resolution
threshold beyond which it is possible for models to forecast it over short time peri‐
ods. Therefore, provided the lookup table is fine-grained enough and the limits of
resolvability are understood, useful approximations can result.
<b>MonteCarlomethods</b>
In reality, tabulating all possible inputs might not be possible, and you might take a
Monte Carlo approach of sampling the input space to create the set of inputs, espe‐
cially where not all possible combinations of inputs are physically possible.
In such cases, overfitting is technically possible (see Figure 4-5, where the unfilled cir‐
cles are approximated by wrong estimates shown by crossed circles).

However, even here, you can see that the ML model will be interpolating between
known answers. The calculation is always deterministic, and it is only the input
points that are subject to random selection. Therefore, these known answers do not
contain noise, and because there are no unobserved variables, errors at unsampled
points will be strictly bounded by the model complexity. Here, the overfitting danger
comes from model complexity and not from fitting to noise. Overfitting is not as
much of a concern when the size of the dataset is larger than the number of free
parameters. Therefore, using a combination of low-complexity models and mild reg‐
ularization provides a practical way to avoid unacceptable overfitting in the case of
Monte Carlo selection of the input space.
<b>Data-drivendiscretizations</b>
Although deriving a closed-form solution is possible for some PDEs, determining
solutions using numerical methods is more common. Numerical methods of PDEs
are already a deep field of research, and there are many books, courses, and journals
devoted to the subject. One common approach is to use finite difference methods,
similar to Runge-Kutta methods, for solving ordinary differential equations. This is
typically done by discretizing the differential operator of the PDE and finding a
