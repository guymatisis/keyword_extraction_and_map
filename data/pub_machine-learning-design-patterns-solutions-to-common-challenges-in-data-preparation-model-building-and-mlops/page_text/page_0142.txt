Consider the situation shown in Figure 4-2. Observations collected from the physical
environment are used as inputs (or initial starting conditions) for a physics-based
model that carries out iterative, numerical calculations to calculate the precise state of
the system. Suppose all the observations have a finite number of possibilities (for
example, temperature will be between 60°C and 80°C in increments of 0.01°C). It is
then possible to create a training dataset for the machine learning system consisting
of the complete input space and calculate the labels using the physical model.

The ML model needs to learn this precisely calculated and nonoverlapping lookup
table of inputs to outputs. Splitting such a dataset into a training dataset and an eval‐
uation dataset is counterproductive because we would then be expecting the model to
learn parts of the input space it will not have seen in the training dataset.

In this scenario, there is no “unseen” data that needs to be generalized to, since all
possible inputs have been tabulated. When building a machine learning model to
learn such a physics model or dynamical system, there is no such thing as overfitting.
The basic machine learning training paradigm is slightly different. Here, there is
some physical phenomenon that you are trying to learn that is governed by an under‐
lying PDE or system of PDEs. Machine learning merely provides a data-driven
