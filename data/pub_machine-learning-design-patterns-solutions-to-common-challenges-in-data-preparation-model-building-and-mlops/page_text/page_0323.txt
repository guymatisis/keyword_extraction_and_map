Many of the scenarios in Table 7-1 refer to “important features.” These are important
features in the sense that they are widely accepted within the business as having a
well-understood impact on the prediction problem. In particular, these are not fea‐
tures ascertained using feature importance methods on your training dataset. As an
example, it’s well accepted within the taxicab industry that the most important deter‐
minant of a taxi fare is distance, and that longer trips cost more. That’s what makes
distance an important feature, not the outcome of a feature importance study.
