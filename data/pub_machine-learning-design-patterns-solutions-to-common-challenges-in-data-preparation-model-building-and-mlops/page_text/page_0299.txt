computing the distance between the pickup and dropoff is a useful feature. Once this
feature is computed on the dataset, we can store it within a feature set for future use.

pandas dataframe or a streaming Kafka topic. are how Feast knows
where to source the data it needs for a feature, how to ingest it, and some basic char‐
acteristics about the data types. Groups of features can be ingested and stored
together, and feature sets provide efficient storage and logical namespacing of data
within these stores.
Once our feature set is registered, Feast will start an Apache Beam job to populate the
feature store with data from the source. A feature set is used to generate both offline
and online feature stores, which ensures developers train and serve their model with
the same data. Feast ensures that the source data complies with the expected schema
of the feature set.
There are four steps to ingest feature data into Feast, as shown in Figure 6-14.
