When you get more data, first train it with the old settings, then increase the number
of examples to reflect the new data, and finally change the STOP_POINT to reflect the
number of times you have to traverse the data to attain convergence.
This is now safe even with hyperparameter tuning (discussed later in this chapter)
and retains all the advantages of keeping the number of steps constant.

In Transfer Learning, we take part of a previously trained model, freeze the weights,
and incorporate these nontrainable layers into a new model that solves a similar
problem, but on a smaller dataset.
<header><largefont><b>Problem</b></largefont></header>
Training custom ML models on unstructured data requires extremely large datasets,
which are not always readily available. Consider the case of a model identifying
whether an x-ray of an arm contains a broken bone. To achieve high accuracy, you’ll
need hundreds of thousands of images, if not more. Before your model learns what a
broken bone looks like, it needs to first learn to make sense of the pixels, edges, and
shapes that are part of the images in your dataset. The same is true for models trained
on text data. Let’s say we’re building a model that takes descriptions of patient symp‐
toms and predicts the possible conditions associated with those symptoms. In addi‐
tion to learning which words differentiate a cold from pneumonia, the model also
needs to learn basic language semantics and how the sequence of words creates
meaning. For example, the model would need to not only learn to detect the presence
of the word <i>fever,</i> but that the sequence <i>no</i> <i>fever</i> carries a very different meaning than
<i>high</i> <i>fever.</i>
