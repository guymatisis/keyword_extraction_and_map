<i>BigQuery</i> is an enterprise data warehouse designed for analyzing large datasets
quickly with SQL. We’ll use BigQuery in our examples for data collection and feature
engineering. Data in BigQuery is organized by Datasets, and a Dataset can have mul‐
tiple Tables. Many of our examples will use data from <i>Google</i> <i>Cloud</i> <i>Public</i> <i>Datasets,</i> a
set of free, publicly available data hosted in BigQuery. Google Cloud Public Datasets
consists of hundreds of different datasets, including NOAA weather data since 1929,
Stack Overflow questions and answers, open source code from GitHub, natality data,
and more. To build some of the models in our examples, we’ll use <i>BigQuery</i> <i>Machine</i>
<i>Learning</i> (or BigQuery ML). BigQuery ML is a tool for building models from data
stored in BigQuery. With BigQuery ML, we can train, evaluate, and generate predic‐
tions on our models using SQL. It supports classification and regression models,
along with unsupervised clustering models. It’s also possible to import previously
trained TensorFlow models to BigQuery ML for prediction.
<i>Cloud</i> <i>AI</i> <i>Platform</i> includes a variety of products for training and serving custom
machine learning models on Google Cloud. In our examples, we’ll be using AI Plat‐
form Training and AI Platform Prediction. AI Platform Training provides infrastruc‐
ture for training machine learning models on Google Cloud. With AI Platform
Prediction, you can deploy your trained models and generate predictions on them
using an API. Both services support TensorFlow, scikit-Learn, and XGBoost models,
along with custom containers for models built with other frameworks. We’ll also ref‐
erence <i>Explainable</i> <i>AI,</i> a tool for interpreting the results of your model’s predictions,
available for models deployed to AI Platform.

Within an organization, there are many different job roles relating to data and
machine learning. Below we’ll define a few common ones referenced frequently
throughout the book. This book is targeted primarily at data scientists, data engi‐
neers, and ML engineers, so let’s start with those.
A <i>data</i> <i>scientist</i> is someone focused on collecting, interpreting, and processing data‐
sets. They run statistical and exploratory analysis on data. As it relates to machine
learning, a data scientist may work on data collection, feature engineering, model
building, and more. Data scientists often work in Python or R in a notebook
environment, and are usually the first to build out an organization’s machine learn‐
ing models.
A <i>data</i> <i>engineer</i> is focused on the infrastructure and workflows powering an organi‐
zation’s data. They might help manage how a company ingests data, data pipelines,
and how data is stored and transferred. Data engineers implement infrastructure and
pipelines around data.
<i>Machine</i> <i>learning</i> <i>engineers</i> do similar tasks to data engineers, but for ML models.
They take models developed by data scientists, and manage the infrastructure and
