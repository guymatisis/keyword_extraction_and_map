bucket. In these cases, it simplifies later machine learning to additionally store the
embeddings of the text columns or of the images as array-type columns. Doing so
will enable the easy incorporation of such unstructured data into machine learning
models.
To create text embeddings, we can load a pre-trained model such as Swivel from
TensorFlow Hub into BigQuery. The full code is on GitHub:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL advdata.swivel_text_embed
OPTIONS(model_type='tensorflow', model_path='gs://BUCKET/swivel/*')
Then, use the model to transform the natural language text column into an embed‐
ding array and store the embedding lookup into a new table:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE advdata.comments_embedding AS
SELECT
output_0 <b>as</b> comments_embedding,
comments
FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL advdata.swivel_text_embed,(
SELECT comments, LOWER(comments) AS sentences
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_preliminary_severe_storms.wind_reports`
))
It is now possible to join against this table to get the text embedding for any com‐
ment. For image embeddings, we can similarly transform image URLs into embed‐
dings and load them into the data warehouse.
Precomputing features in this manner is an example of the “Design Pattern 26: Fea‐
ture Store” on page 295 (see Chapter 6).

The Feature Cross design pattern helps models learn relationships between inputs
faster by explicitly making each combination of input values a separate feature.
<header><largefont><b>Problem</b></largefont></header>
Consider the dataset in Figure 2-14 and the task of creating a binary classifier that
separates the + and − labels.
Using only the <i>x_1</i> and <i>x_2</i> coordinates, it is not possible to find a linear boundary
that separates the + and − classes.
This means that to solve this problem, we have to make the model more complex,
perhaps by adding more layers to the model. However, a simpler solution exists.
