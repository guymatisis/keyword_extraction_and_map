In engineering disciplines, design patterns capture best practices and solutions to
commonly occurring problems. They codify the knowledge and experience of experts
into advice that all practitioners can follow. This book is a catalog of machine learn‐
ing design patterns that we have observed in the course of working with hundreds of
machine learning teams.

The idea of patterns, and a catalog of proven patterns, was introduced in the field of
architecture by Christopher Alexander and five coauthors in a hugely influential
book titled <i>A</i> <i>Pattern</i> <i>Language</i> (Oxford University Press, 1977). In their book, they
catalog 253 patterns, introducing them this way:
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environ‐
ment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that
you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way
twice.
…
Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field of relationships
needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you can
solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences,
and the local conditions at the place where you are making it.
For example, a couple of the patterns that incorporate human details when building a
home are <i>Light</i> <i>on</i> <i>Two</i> <i>Sides</i> <i>of</i> <i>Every</i> <i>Room</i> and <i>Six-Foot</i> <i>Balcony.</i> Think of your
favorite room in your home, and your least-favorite room. Does your favorite room
