pixels, it doesn’t rain. In such a case, it can be helpful to create a stacked classification
model followed by a regression model:
1. First, predict whether or not it is going to rain.
2. For pixels where the model predicts rain is not likely, predict a rainfall amount of
zero.
3. Train a regression model to predict the rainfall amount on pixels where the
model predicts that rain is likely.
It is critical to realize that the classification model is not perfect, and so the regression
model has to be trained on the pixels that the classification model predicts as likely to
be raining (and not just on pixels that correspond to rain in the labeled dataset). For
complementary solutions to this problem, also see the discussions on “Design Pattern
10: Rebalancing ” on page 122 and “Design Pattern 5: Reframing ” on page 80.

In many classification situations, creating a neutral class can be helpful. For example,
instead of training a binary classifier that outputs the probability of an event, train a
three-class classifier that outputs disjoint probabilities for Yes, No, and Maybe. Dis‐
joint here means that the classes do not overlap. A training pattern can belong to only
one class, and so there is no overlap between Yes and Maybe, for example. The
Maybe in this case is the neutral class.

Imagine that we are trying to create a model that provides guidance on pain relievers.
There are two choices, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, 2 and it turns out in our histori‐
cal dataset that acetaminophen tends to be prescribed preferentially to patients at risk
of stomach problems, and ibuprofen tends to be prescribed preferentially to patients
at risk of liver damage. Beyond that, things tend to be quite random; some physicians
default to acetaminophen and others to ibuprofen.
Training a binary classifier on such a dataset will lead to poor accuracy because the
model will need to get the essentially arbitrary cases correct.
