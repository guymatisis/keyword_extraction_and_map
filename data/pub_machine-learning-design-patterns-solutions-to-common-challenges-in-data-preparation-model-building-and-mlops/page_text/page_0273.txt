<b>Handlingprecisionincreases</b>
When the input provider increases the precision of their data stream, follow the
bridging approach to create a training dataset that consists of the higher-resolution
data, augmented with some of the older data.
For floating-point values, it is not necessary to explicitly bridge the older data to
match the newer data’s precision. To see why, consider the case where some data was
originally provided to one decimal place (e.g., 3.5 or 4.2) but is now being provided to
two decimal places (e.g., 3.48 or 4.23). If we assume that 3.5 in the older data consists
distributed1
of values that would be uniformly in [3.45, 3.55] in the newer data, the
statically imputed value would be 3.5, which is precisely the value that is stored in the
older data.
For categorical values—for example, if the older data stored the location as a state or
provincial code and the newer data provided the county or district code—use the fre‐
quency distribution of counties within states as described in the main solution to
carry out static imputation.

The Windowed Inference design pattern handles models that require an ongoing
sequence of instances in order to run inference. This pattern works by externalizing
the model state and invoking the model from a stream analytics pipeline. This pat‐
tern is also useful when a machine learning model requires features that need to be
computed from aggregates over time windows. By externalizing the state to a stream
pipeline, the Windowed Inference design pattern ensures that features calculated in a
dynamic, time-dependent way can be correctly repeated between training and
serving. It is a way of avoiding training–serving skew in the case of temporal aggre‐
gate features.

couple of days in May 2010 in Figure 6-5 (the full notebook is on GitHub).
