<i>unsupervised</i> <i>learning,</i> you do not know the labels for your data in advance, and the
goal is to build a model that can find natural groupings of your data (called <i>cluster‐</i>
<i>ing),</i> compress the information content (dimensionality <i>reduction),</i> or find associa‐
tion rules. The majority of this book will focus on supervised learning because the
vast majority of machine learning models used in production are supervised.
With supervised learning, problems can typically be defined as either classification or
regression. <i>Classification</i> models assign your input data a label (or labels) from a dis‐
crete, predefined set of categories. Examples of classification problems include deter‐
mining the type of pet breed in an image, tagging a document, or predicting whether
or not a transaction is fraudulent. <i>Regression</i> models assign continuous, numerical
values to your inputs. Examples of regression models include predicting the duration
of a bike trip, a company’s future revenue, or the price of a product.

Data is at the heart of any machine learning problem. When we talk about <i>datasets,</i>
we’re referring to the data used for training, validating, and testing a machine learn‐
ing model. The bulk of your data will be <i>training</i> <i>data:</i> the data fed to your model
during the training process. <i>Validation</i> <i>data</i> is data that is held out from your train‐
ing set and used to evaluate how the model is performing after each training <i>epoch</i>
(or pass through the training data). The performance of the model on the validation
data is used to decide when to stop the training run, and to choose <i>hyperparameters,</i>
such as the number of trees in a random forest model. <i>Test</i> <i>data</i> is data that is not
used in the training process at all and is used to evaluate how the trained model per‐
forms. Performance reports of the machine learning model must be computed on the
independent test data, rather than the training or validation tests. It’s also important
that the data be split in such a way that all three datasets (training, test, validation)
have similar statistical properties.
The data you use to train your model can take many forms depending on the model
type. We define <i>structured</i> <i>data</i> as numerical and categorical data. Numerical data
includes integer and float values, and categorical data includes data that can be divi‐
ded into a finite set of groups, like type of car or education level. You can also think
of structured data as data you would commonly find in a spreadsheet. Throughout
the book, we’ll use the term <i>tabular</i> <i>data</i> interchangeably with structured data.
<i>Unstructured</i> <i>data,</i> on the other hand, includes data that cannot be represented as
neatly. This typically includes free-form text, images, video, and audio.
Numeric data can often be fed directly to a machine learning model, where other data
requires various <i>data</i> <i>preprocessing</i> before it’s ready to be sent to a model. This pre‐
processing step typically includes scaling numerical values, or converting nonnumer‐
ical data into a numerical format that can be understood by your model. Another
