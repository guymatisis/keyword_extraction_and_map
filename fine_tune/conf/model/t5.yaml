# T5 Model Configuration
# 
# This configuration defines settings for the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model,
# which can be adapted for keyphrase generation tasks.
#
# Parameters:
#   name: HuggingFace model identifier (t5-base, t5-small, t5-large also available)
#   max_input_length: Maximum number of tokens for input text
#   max_output_length: Maximum number of tokens for generated keyphrases
#
# Usage:
#   To use T5 instead of KeyBART:
#   python fine_tune.py model=t5 run_name=my_t5_experiment

name: t5-base
max_input_length: 512  # T5's typical sequence length for efficient processing
max_output_length: 64  # Kept same as KeyBART for consistency
